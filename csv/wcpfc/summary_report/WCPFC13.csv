WCPFC13,6,A list of all participants is attached (Attachment A). WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 4 of 3611.1 Welcome address
WCPFC13,7,"After a devotion by Reverend Kolinio Bulivakarua and a Fijian traditional ceremony of welcome, the Fijian Minister for Forests, the Hon. Osea Naiqamu, gave the opening address. Stressing the need for cooperation to meet objectives of the Convention and commitment to working together, the Minister noted that fisheries management was a vocation for many countries. The Minister noted that long term sustainability is necessary for Fiji’s people and for future generations. The Minister’s full speech is attached at Attachment B."
WCPFC13,8,"The Commission Chair, Ms Rhea Moss-Christian, made some opening remarks highlighting the importance of making progress through a step-wise, incremental approach, and the need for CCMs to avoid adopting an all-or-nothing mentality. The Chair’s full speech is attached at Attachment C."
WCPFC13,9,"In the WCPFC Executive Director’s opening remarks, Feleti Teo, OBE, noted that divergent interests within the Commission meant that negotiations were always difficult. The Executive Director stressed that the Commission’s focus should be firmly on sustainability of stocks, and those issues that were most critical, including implementing the harvest strategy approach to fisheries management, where parties agree in advance what the Commission should do when a stock reaches a certain status. The Executive Director noted the remarkable job Fiji had done to host the meeting, given the damage to Fiji from 2016’s Cyclone Winston. The Executive Director’s full speech is attached at Attachment D."
WCPFC13,10,The meeting opened at 10am on Monday 5 December 2016. 1.2 Adoption of agenda
WCPFC13,11,"In a brief discussion of the agenda (WCPFC13-2016-01_rev1), it was agreed that Korea could raise its payback plan for Pacific bluefin tuna under agenda item 9.5."
WCPFC13,12,"The agenda was adopted without amendment (Attachment E). 1.3 Meeting arrangements 1.3.1 Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMS, Others)"
WCPFC13,13,"The following small working groups (SWGs) were established to deal with issues in the margins of the meeting and to provide a report for consideration by plenary:  determination of interim acceptable levels of risk (led by Vice-Chair, Russell Smith)   observer safety (led by USA)  bigeye tuna rebuilding timelines (led by Australia)  finalisation of the CMR (led by TCC Chair, Alexa Cole (USA))  South Pacific albacore TRP (led by Samoa)  determination of the participatory rights for CNMs (led by Canada)  management objectives (led by Japan)"
WCPFC13,14,"In addition, drafting groups were established to progress the bridging tropical tuna measure (led by the Chair) and the bridging South Pacific albacore measure (led by New Zealand), to consult on and draft negotiating texts for WCPFC13 to discuss and the Commission to progress through 2017. It was noted that FAC would continue to meet in the margins of WCPFC13. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 5 of 3611.3.2. Election of FAC co-chair"
WCPFC13,15,The Commission appointed Magele Etuati Ropeti (Samoa) to be FAC co-chair.
WCPFC13,16,"Ropeti’s duties began immediately, to assist FAC10 to progress its work in the margins. AGENDA ITEM 2 — REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC13,17,"As required by Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission, the Executive Director presented his Annual Report for 2016 (WCPFC13-2016-05), highlighting the main work programmes and activities of the Commission and its Secretariat for 2016. The Executive Director noted that Pohnpei, FSM had hosted Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in September for their annual meeting, and the WCPFC Secretariat had hosted side meetings of leaders, and a dinner reception for Pacific leaders and representatives of development partners who are all members of the Commission. Continued outreach by the Commission Chair and Executive Director to assist in the preparation for WCPFC13 was noted. The work program was delivered on time with intended objectives and outputs accomplished. The Commission was supported by four subsidiary bodies, SC, TCC, NC and the FAC, as well as three intersessional working groups, CDS-IWG, ERandEMWG and FADMgmtOptions-IWG. The Executive Director thanked the Chairs and Co-Chairs who drove the work in these bodies. The work plans for the four subsidiary bodies to be considered by WCPFC13 formed the bulk of the 2017 Commission work program. Work would also continue on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) and strategic planning. The Executive Director noted a two-day workshop in 2016 had provided an opportunity for frank exchanges on key strategic objectives and priorities for the Commission; the draft Strategic Plan would be tabled during WCPFC13 for consideration and further guidance by the Commission. The Executive Director reported that the Commission’s financial affairs were in order, as tabled to FAC10. The Secretariat had added an IT officer to its staff. Contributions from USA for the special fund, Korea for tagging work, the Japan Trust Fund, and EU for supporting various scientific projects, were acknowledged, as was New Zealand’s intention to contribute to the Sustainable Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the West Pacific and East Asian Seas (WPEA-SM) project. NGO contributions were also acknowledged, including ISSF funding for an MSE workshop and NORMA’s continued funding for co-hosting Commission meetings in Pohnpei. The Executive Director recognised the work of the Commission’s Scientific Services Provider and data manager the Pacific Community – Oceanic Fisheries Programme (SPC-OFP), FFA as the Commission’s VMS provider and The International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) as the Scientific Services Provider for NC. The Executive Director noted the continued promotion of cooperation with other organisations, which is an obligation under the Convention. The Executive Director met with the heads of IOTC, IATTC, CCSBT and ICCAT while in Rome for FAO COFI meeting this year, and participated in the Regional Fishery Body Secretariats Network. It was noted that the Commission was successfully managing two major projects – the bycatch component of the ABNJ Common Oceans project, and the WPEA."
WCPFC13,18,The Commission accepted the 2016 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC13-2016-05).
WCPFC13,19,"Fiji expressed appreciation for the Executive Director’s efforts to revive quarterly reports and did not consider major meeting outcomes were required in these reports so much as information relating to intersessional issues and events. FFA members noted the large number of Commission-hosted meetings which continued to be demanding and costly. These CCMs suggested that the Commission revert to discussing substantive business in two meeting sessions, and hoped the Corporate Plan would help streamline and focus processes and Commission work.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 6 of 361"
WCPFC13,20,"The Executive Director noted that the Secretariat follows the tasking of the Commission, the work program for which was decided by the Commission."
WCPFC13,21,Japan also noted the numerous RFMO meetings and suggested the Commission take care when considering scheduling more intersessional meetings.
WCPFC13,22,"EU noted its support for the Commission’s science and research priorities in 2017 and its financial support for a number of activities. This CCM considered research on FADs to be a top priority for the Commission. It was noted that a research plan for FADs had not yet been adopted, but the FADMgmtOptions-IWG had identified research priorities. AGENDA ITEM 3 — STATEMENTS FROM MEMBERS AND  PARTICIPATING TERRITORIES"
WCPFC13,23,"Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development, HE Shane Jones (New Zealand) noted the high priority New Zealand attaches to the management and development of the region’s fisheries, and noted the vital source of income and employment fisheries provide to the region. Effective management is critical to ensure sustainability into the future. The conservation and management measures (CMMs) adopted by the Commission go a long way towards supporting the objectives of Pacific Leaders. It was incumbent on Commission members to recognise the significance to SIDS of the region’s tuna resource, and to act accordingly and fairly. It is the role of the Commission to ensure the costs of conserving the tuna resource are fairly distributed – a key consideration as CCMs work towards new management arrangements for tropical tunas. The challenge is to see beyond individual positions to reach agreement on measures that consider the impact on all players and provide for mutually beneficial solutions. New Zealand looked forward to the progress that will be made this week by members dedicated to stronger and more effective management of this region’s valuable tuna resource."
WCPFC13,24,"The Hon. Alfred Alfred, Jr., Minister for Resources and Development (RMI) recalled that RMI led negotiations on CMM 2013-06 and CMM 2013-07, which are premised upon Article 30 of the Convention which safeguards the special requirements of SIDS. RMI continues to be concerned with proposals tabled by CCMs without direct consultations with SIDS, despite them being likely to have adverse impacts on the people and livelihoods of SIDS. At WCPFC13, RMI would highlight the importance of effectively operationalizing these two measures. RMI would also work to progress observer safety and operational data provision, to ensure that what has already been agreed is upheld and maintained with the highest standards of accountability and transparency. RMI would engage frankly and openly, taking into account the competing interests and polarizing positions that may potentially ensue over the course of the meeting."
WCPFC13,25,"The Minister for Fisheries, Semi Koroilavesau (Fiji) noted the need for engaging SIDS and avoiding disproportionate burden. Other issues important to Fiji to be discussed at WCPFC13 were mobula and manta rays bycatch reporting and control of vessels."
WCPFC13,26,"The Minister for Fisheries; Hon Mao Zeming (PNG) congratulated WCPFC for its bold and progressive management of the region’s fisheries resources, efforts that have gained recognition at the global level with the United Nations General Assembly resolution to commemorate World Tuna Day. PNG acknowledged the support of the Commission, PNA, SPC and FFA on the support provided towards achieving this. World Tuna Day puts Pacific Islands on the global stage, with the largest tuna resource in the world. Several key issues are evident in the WCPFC13 agenda, principally strengthening regional cooperation, streamlining the Commission’s focus on sustainable fisheries management and addressing the development aspirations of SIDS. A lack of prudent action on the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 7 of 361high seas and the disproportionate burden of conservation action hinder SIDS from maximizing their full potential in fisheries. PNG called on the Commission to ensure effective and appropriate mechanisms are developed to encourage members to comply with their obligations under measures adopted by the Commission, including the effective management of the high seas. Consistent with PNG’s 2014 National Strategy for meeting the UN Sustainability Goals, PNG is embracing a systematic approach to sustainability in which the economic, socio-political and environmental systems are embedded. It is now a national priority of the PNG Government, whereby principles of responsible sustainable development mean fully gaining from PNG’s natural resources and providing equal opportunities for future generations."
WCPFC13,27,"The Hon. Puakena Boreham, Minister for Natural Resources (Tuvalu) reminded the Commission of the critical importance of its decisions to a small island nation like Tuvalu. Tuvalu is possibly the most fishery-dependent nation on earth. Tuvalu holds deep concerns that the Commission develop fishery management arrangements that are effective and equitable. Tuvalu has been rigorously implementing the 4th month FAD closure, which has greatly reduced the profitability and attractiveness of fishing in Tuvalu waters, and compromised fishery revenues. But other WCPFC coastal states have failed to impose the FAD closure in their waters, and DWFN longliners did not deliver the bigeye catch reductions they committed to. Tuvalu remains committed to the goals of the Commission, but is also determined not to carry a disproportionate share of burden."
WCPFC13,28,"Solomon Islands believes the Commission needs to take strong action on the following critical issues: the Pacific bluefin tuna fishery; a measure to give greater protection to the health and safety of our observers; progress on the development of harvest strategies for all tuna species, especially skipjack tuna and South Pacific albacore; reform of the CMS, which is currently unfair to SIDS; progress on the bridging measures for tropical tunas and South Pacific albacore. Solomon Islands noted its commitment to constructively work with all members to achieve outcomes on these and other agenda items and re-affirmed its commitment to the Commission. Solomon Islands informed the Commission that it is implementing the longline VDS in its national waters from 1 January 2017, with key e- reporting and e-monitoring components. These developments will enhance compliance monitoring and data quality for science, and improve longline fisheries management as a whole. Solomon Islands looked forward to the day when the Commission implements compatible longline measures for the high seas."
WCPFC13,29,"American Samoa noted that its economy is highly dependent on sustainable fisheries in the Convention area, and is also vulnerable to the decisions of the Commission."
WCPFC13,30,"FSM wanted to see the adoption of the draft CMM on observer safety to ensure the protection of human lives, the Commission’s eyes and ears at sea. FSM acknowledged the Chair’s efforts on the bridging tropical tuna measure and was keen to see the harvest strategies work move forward. FSM noted the discussions regarding a review of the CMS, the objectives for which must be crafted in a way that clarifies that the CMS is positive and proactive. FSM wants to preserve the recognition of the chartering scheme in all measures where appropriate, while ensuring that the arrangement does not become a means for countries to evade their capacity limits. FSM considers there to be an urgent need for the Commission to ensure the sustainability of the Special Requirements Fund (SRF). Consideration of the SIDS’ limited capacity to look after the interest of their industries should be noted. FSM noted that Pacific leaders have called for action to end IUU fishing, calling on flag states to exercise more diligent efforts in carrying out flag state responsibilities and control of nationals. Small countries in the Pacific own the vast majority of the resources that come from the ocean in the Convention area and have much at stake as it is their most important natural resource. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 8 of 361"
WCPFC13,31,"The Philippines noted its commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks in the Commission area, consistent with its rights and obligations under UNCLOS, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the WCPF Convention. Nationally, the Philippines’ Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 10654 or the Act to Deter, Eliminate, and Prevent Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing became effective on October 2015. Philippines noted it was a developing state, facing many challenges. The Philippines’ compliance with measures is a work in progress but with an enhanced policy framework in place, Philippines is confident it will overcome the initial transition period with the support of the Commission and cooperation with other CCMs. The Philippines expressed appreciation for the Commission’s continued support through capacity building activities, progressively improving Philippines’s compliance, as reflected in the CMR process each year. The Philippines was pleased to inform the Commission that it will host the next Commission meeting, WCPFC14, in 2017. AGENDA ITEM 4 — MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 4.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC13,32,"No new information had been provided from the depositary of the WCPFC Convention, New Zealand. The status of the Convention is outlined in WCPFC13-2016-06."
WCPFC13,33,The Commission noted the report on Status of Convention (WCPFC13-2016-06). 4.2 Update on Observer status
WCPFC13,34,"There was no discussion under this agenda item, however a lengthy exchange on observer participation took place under agenda item 15.2."
WCPFC13,35,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC13-2016-07). 4.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member status
WCPFC13,36,"The Commission considered applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status for 2017 in accordance with CMM 2009-11 (WCPFC13-2016-08). There were seven applications for CNM status. The Chair noted that one application had been provided with all requisite information (El Salvador), with others requiring further information: for Ecuador, the application was complete after TCC12 so no further information was requested; Liberia had provided the information requested by TCC12; and Vietnam had provided the required information. TCC12 had requested further information from Thailand on its historical fishing activities. Thailand had since confirmed it had no historical fishing activity to report. Panama’s Annual Report Part 1 was outstanding. Panama confirmed during discussions under this agenda item that an email from the Panamanian government had been sent on 2 December containing the required information, including the Annual Report Part 1. This was subsequently verified by the Secretariat during discussions. Mexico’s contribution was outstanding. While Mexico was not present at the commencement of WCPFC13, this matter was taken up by the Commission."
WCPFC13,37,"FFA members expressed that they continued to support a WCPFC decision that CNMs are to provide a contribution to the Commission; and participants need to share the costs of conservation and management of the fish stocks under the Commission’s purview. CNMs pay only 50% of the amount it would if it were a member. Mexico’s contribution was again outstanding, a matter which had been the subject of extensive discussion at the last two Commission meetings. FFA members stated they WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 9 of 361would not agree to CNM status for any applicant with an outstanding financial contribution or who is unable to commit to making the contribution for the next year."
WCPFC13,38,"The Chair noted that after a similar situation last year, Mexico was able to make a payment during the meeting. It was agreed that the informal small working group would consider the applications for CNM status that had been approved (Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam), but not Mexico’s, as it was not present."
WCPFC13,39,USA took the view that contributions are voluntary and that CNM status should not turn on the matter of the payment or non-payment of the contribution.
WCPFC13,40,The Executive Director noted that no delegates from Mexico were yet registered for WCPFC13. Some CCMs suggested that the agenda stay open to wait for a possible Mexico delegation.
WCPFC13,41,"The Commission turned its attention to requests for full membership received from Ecuador and El Salvador. Ecuador noted that it had sent a letter on 16 November 2016, subsequently circulated by Secretariat, outlining its application for full membership. Ecuador explained that it was fully committed to tuna stock conversation and has been a CNM for eight years. It had requested an invitation to become a full member for the last four years. Ecuador has been a member of IATTC for more than 50 years, is a member of SPRMO and party to UNCLOS and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement."
WCPFC13,42,El Salvador noted that it has been a CNM since 2008 and has provided voluntary contributions to the Commission on time annually. El Salvador noted it is an IATTC member and is committed to not increasing fishing capacity in the Western and Central Pacific; its vessel numbers would remain unchanged. El Salvador commented that none of its vessels had been involved in IUU activities and it requires 100% observer coverage on its flagged vessels.
WCPFC13,43,"FFA members considered that the matter needed careful consideration, citing the uniqueness of the Commission. Unlike other RFMOs, the majority of WCPFC members are SIDS who are overwhelmingly dependent on fisheries resources. In addition, the majority of fishing takes place within SIDS’ waters. These CCMs considered that when more of a level playing field for SIDS exists in the Commission, FFA members will be in a position to develop a process for considering inviting new members to join."
WCPFC13,44,"USA welcomed El Salvador’s request, and explained that an obligation is created when an RFMO is established. The Commission had a responsibility to consider the international legal context within which an RFMO is granted rights to manage fish stocks – these include UNCLOS, UNFSA and other international law which provides these institutions authority. There was a responsibility to consider in a meaningful way the interest of other nations to become members. For USA, even the special nature of WCPFC did not obviate the need for the Commission to consider requests fairly. The Convention provides that new members can be admitted through an invitation arrived at through consensus. USA stated that there should be criteria for considering those applications, and it should be a fair, transparent and objective process. Criteria could include whether the prospective member state has the ability to manage its fleets and is willing to exercise that ability. USA considered that an invitation would not come with an automatic right to allocation, and an informal small working group could develop the criteria."
WCPFC13,45,"Other states supported this view, with EU considering that the inclusion of countries participating in IATTC into WCPFC would be beneficial to the organisation. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 10 of 361"
WCPFC13,46,"While WCPFC13 did not reach consensus on accepting the Ecuador and El Salvador applications for full membership of WCPFC, the Chair noted that this did not preclude a CCM starting a process to develop a draft set of criteria for considering requests for membership in 2017."
WCPFC13,47,On 8 December the Commission was informed that a delegate from Mexico had arrived at WCPFC13.
WCPFC13,48,"Mexico made a lengthy statement relating to its CNM status, stating its case for CNM status and noting its commitment to collaborating in the implementation of Commission measures (WCPFC13-2016-08_Att 5 MX)."
WCPFC13,49,"USA thanked Mexico for its comprehensive explanation of both its application and the historical context. USA considered the continued participation of Mexico as a CNM to be important, especially in the context of the NC’s work, and encouraged the Commission to accept Mexico as a CNM in 2017."
WCPFC13,50,"Japan also supported the application, noting that Mexico does not fish in the Convention area but contributes to the Commission as a member of IATTC on the management of Pacific bluefin tuna. Mexico had not made a voluntary contribution but was committed to making a financial contribution. Canada, China, Indonesia, Korea and Chinese Taipei also supported Mexico’s application. It was noted that Mexico was a key member of IATTC."
WCPFC13,51,"Regarding the issue of whether contributions were voluntary or not, EU did not consider it was a condition according to the Convention. This CCM asked that the Commission provide legal certainty."
WCPFC13,52,Canada considered that Mexico’s payment schedule should meet the Commission’s expectations regarding financial contributions.
WCPFC13,53,Nauru noted that the Commission debates the issue each year. All participants contribute to the Commission through their participation and financial contributions. CNMs have a 50% discount on member contributions. This CCM noted that Mexico’s explanation about its non-payment was new and some time was needed to consider it.
WCPFC13,54,"After discussions in an informal small working group, on 9 December, FFA members advised that they accepted Mexico’s offer, conditional on the payment schedule it had offered. Mexico thanked the Commission for considering its application and reiterated it would stand by the offer made."
WCPFC13,55,New Zealand suggested a specific date that the payment would be provided to the Secretariat would be useful.
WCPFC13,56,"The report of the informal small working group, which met three times during WCPFC13, was accepted by WCPFC13:"
WCPFC13,57,"For 2017, seven CNM requests were submitted to the Secretariat using the agreed electronic format within the required timeframe. Those requests were from: Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam."
WCPFC13,58,"WCPFC13 approved CNM status to Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam for 2017."
WCPFC13,59,"WCPFC13 also approved CNM status to Mexico for 2017, subject to the payment of Mexico’s 2016 assessed financial contribution by June 30 2017 (payment in the first semester) and its 2017 assessed contribution by December 31 2017 (payment in the second semester).   WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 11 of 361"
WCPFC13,60,"At the Chair’s direction, a small working group (SWG) was established to assess associated participatory rights of each CNM applicant whose CNM status was approved at the plenary. Framework documents for the working group were CMM 2009-11 and Secretariat paper WCPFC13-2016-08. The group also referred to TCC12’s recommendations in the CNM section of the TCC12 Summary Report."
WCPFC13,61,"The SWG noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam in the Group’s discussions."
WCPFC13,62,"In addition to the discussions regarding participatory rights, some of the attending CNMs also raised the question as to how the Commission invites a non-member to become a full member, noting that Ecuador, El Salvador, and Vietnam had expressed their interest in becoming a full member of the Commission in their CNM applications."
WCPFC13,63,Participants supported the recommendation of TCC12 to include a column in the template where CNM applicants could indicate their interest in becoming a member of the commission but felt that further discussion was not warranted on the membership process as the issue was outside the mandate of the SWG.
WCPFC13,64,It was confirmed that applications were complete and outstanding data addressed for the seven applicants. 4.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs
WCPFC13,65,"The SWG agreed to recommend that the CNMs accepted by the WCPFC plenary (i.e. Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam) have the same participatory rights in 2017 as they had in 2016."
WCPFC13,66,"WCPFC13 agreed to the following limits to be applied to the participatory rights of CNMs (Convention / CMM 2009-11):  a. In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  b. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  c. CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPFC Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV).  d. CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  e. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPFC Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the Secretariat for attention by TCC. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 12 of 361 Participatory rights of each CNM in 2017 Ecuador"
WCPFC13,67,"The participatory rights for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2015-01 or its replacement measure. El Salvador"
WCPFC13,68,The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2015-01 or its replacement measure. Liberia
WCPFC13,69,"The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to reefer vessels to engage in transhipment activities, and bunker and supply vessels to support fishing vessels in the Convention area. Mexico"
WCPFC13,70,"It was noted that Mexico had participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to continue to participate in the NC. Mexico does not intend to have a vessel presence in 2017. Any future introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2015-01 or its replacement measure. Panama"
WCPFC13,71,"The participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transhipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs. The SWG also noted that this does not result in any additional participatory rights in 2017 to the participatory rights granted to Panama in 2016. Thailand"
WCPFC13,72,The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. Vietnam
WCPFC13,73,The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 13 of 361WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC13,74,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area."
WCPFC13,75,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC13,76,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area. Amendment to be made to the CNM request template"
WCPFC13,77,"WCPFC13 agreed, as originally recommended by TCC12, to include a column in the CNM application template where CNM applicants could indicate their interest in becoming a member of the Commission. The Secretariat was tasked with making the necessary amendment to the CNM request template.  AGENDA ITEM 5 — NEW PROPOSALS"
WCPFC13,78,"CCMs were asked to present their proposals to WCPFC13, noting that proposals addressing matters best covered under other agenda items would be presented there. Proposals requiring additional work before their adoption were given the benefit of informal discussion time throughout the meeting in small groups. Observer safety"
WCPFC13,79,"The USA proposal relating to observer safety (WCPFC13-2016-DP21) was worked on by a large number of CCMs and observers – over 100 – in an informal small working group which met four times in the margins of the meeting, including one session which went late into the night. On 8 December USA reported that the primary remaining sticking point was the legally binding nature of the agreement, and noted that Japan had received legal advice and provided input into the document."
WCPFC13,80,"China noted that observer safety was paramount, and recalled the clear decision made last year that the Commission would put time into crafting an agreement. China recognised the sticking points around the legal mechanism to be used for the agreement and asked the Commission to think laterally about the issue. While it was not ideal to have something that is not binding, China commented that there may be other ways to meet the paramount objective of ensuring the safety of observers."
WCPFC13,81,"USA brought the draft measure to plenary for adoption on 9 December for the Commission’s consideration, noting that through much effort in the working group discussions the text no longer had any square brackets. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 14 of 361"
WCPFC13,82,"Japan thanked the informal small working group chair, Alexa Cole (USA) for her hard work but noted legal difficulties it had in implementing the provisions in the measure. This CCM expressed sincere thanks for the special consideration for Japan through the footnotes in the measure, giving it some exemptions from the obligation to implement the provisions. Japan noted the efforts it had made to obtain final approval from Tokyo on the language which had been formulated by the Japanese delegates at WCPFC13 but considered it highly unlikely that they would receive clear instructions before WCPFC13 closed. Japan apologised if this would undermine the Commission’s efforts but there was no option but for Japan to oppose the adoption of the measure as they did not have instructions to support it."
WCPFC13,83,"Chinese Taipei recognised the importance of observers and supported the adoption of the measure, though noting that during discussions in the informal small working group it had expressed deep concern about definition of “harassment” and “harass”. As it was agreed by the informal small working group that each CCM has the right to interpret the definition of the discussed words with applicable domestic laws, this CCM agreed to adopt this measure."
WCPFC13,84,"WWF decried the inability of the Commission to adopt the measure. Noting that this observer had hoped to be able to express admiration for the work of all involvement in getting it adopted, WWF regretted that it could not now do that. WWF stated that the Commission had abdicated its duty to the people that serve in its fisheries, gathering the critical data it uses to manage stocks. The Commission was responsible for these observers and if the Commission was really treating them as of paramount importance it should approve this measure. In six years, five observers had died doing their work. WWF had heard a lot during the informal small working group sessions about domestic legal constraints making a CCM unable to implement the measure. WWF stated that that there should be a burden of proof for this; information should be provided to the Commission as evidence of this constraint. In addition, the burden should be on CCMs to prove an observer complaint was untrue. WWF felt strongly that these issues were not esoteric; observers are human beings and the Commission owed them its protection."
WCPFC13,85,"PNG commented that it had the biggest observer programme in the region and it hurt when observers disappear. PNG sacrifices budget to ensure the families of those who have gone missing are taken care of. PNG expressed its gratitude to participants of the informal small working group but noted its disappointment that the measure did not have consensus as observers were human beings, not objects."
WCPFC13,86,"RMI supported the comments by PNG and WWF and noted that despite the push on this issue it had missed what it had hoped to achieve on observer safety. Legal constraints aside, this CCM noted that as an observer provider RMI will go out of its way to ensure observer safety."
WCPFC13,87,"Australia acknowledged the foregoing comments and the USA for the extraordinary effort it had put into crafting the measure. An observer safety measure would form part of the rights and responsibilities of vessel operators and captains outlined in CMM 2007-01, which already requires that ROP observers not be assaulted, obstructed, resisted, delayed, intimidated, interfered with, influenced bribed, or attempted to be bribed in the performance of their duties. The duty to render assistance and protect human life is required by UNCLOS. The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue outlines responsibilities of governments related to search and rescue. Australia noted that experience has shown that these are not enough, with five deaths in six years. Observers play a critical role in meeting the Commission’s responsibilities for fisheries management and are essential to ensuring the integrity of management measures. Australia considered them to be like diplomats: they must be able to conduct their jobs unimpeded and in a safe environment, free of threats and intimidation. Their personal safety is paramount. In addition, this is about human life and safety; the seas are a dangerous place. People doing work on the Commission’s behalf should be able to go to their jobs and come WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 15 of 361home to their families at the end of a trip knowing that everything that can reasonably be done is being done to keep them safe. Preventative actions and education are important to ensuring observers remain safe –including providing observers with the right to refuse to board without recrimination or loss of pay if the vessel does not meet standard safety requirements; protecting them from intimidation, threats and assaults; entitling them to respect; providing access to medical care if sick or injured; immediate action and cooperation on search and rescue if an observer goes missing; prompt arrangements for the return of the body to the observer’s family in the unfortunate event an observer dies. Australia considered that flag states have a responsibility to ensure regular industry education on the importance of accurate data and providing a safe environment for observers under national laws. Observer training and adequate observer insurance are also important issues, but should not stop the Commission taking action on observer safety."
WCPFC13,88,"FSM noted that many observers from its own observer program are placed on WCPFC vessels. This CCM was not sure how it was going to be able to place its observers on vessels without this measure, commenting that FSM needs to make sure they come back to their families."
WCPFC13,89,Vanuatu voiced its concern and requested observer providers to advise what the implications were if the Commission could not get the measure through. It asked if there would be penalties for not putting observers on vessels.
WCPFC13,90,"Nauru, one of the smallest observer providers, expressed disappointment. This CCM noted the long discussions in the informal small working group, including comments from some participants that observers were just like crew. However, Nauru stated that observers are not crew, and are not covered by the ILO Convention which is why CCMs fight for them within the Commission. This CCM also noted the insurance issue other CCMs had mentioned. If Nauru did not put observers on CCMs’ boats, there was an outstanding question of whether those boats could fish. From 1 January 2017, Nauru would be implementing this in its EEZ. This CCM questioned why Japan needed to talk with capital about the language in the measure, noting that all CCMs come to WCPFC with a mandate and brought credentials to this effect. Nauru suggested taking the matter of adopting the measure to a vote."
WCPFC13,91,"Kiribati noted that if safety of observers was not guaranteed, it could not put them on boats. This CCM supported the recommendation to put the matter to a vote."
WCPFC13,92,"EU noted its support for the measure and expressed disappointed that consensus could not be reached. While EU did not think there should be exemptions, it considered that the text had taken Japan’s concerns into account. This CCM preferred consensus, not a vote, and invited Japan to reconsider its position."
WCPFC13,93,"PNG noted WWF’s impassioned statement at WCPFC12 and how hard the Commission had worked to get the measure across the line at WCPFC13. This CCM noted that observers in the Pacific are a close knit group of people and, as an observer provider, PNG deals with them daily. PNG came to WCPFC13 with a mandate to agree this measure and asked how the Commission could value the lives of fish and not uphold the sanctity of human life."
WCPFC13,94,Samoa expressed it disappointment in the delaying tactics it had observed. This CCM wished participants had seen how observers are sometimes treated on boats. These observers are from small island nations and go full-hearted to their work. Samoa noted there were other international obligations that need to be met by CCMs on observer safety.
WCPFC13,95,"Tuvalu expressed disappointment that one CCM was blocking the measure after receiving exemptions. This CCM stated that all reasonable attempts to reach consensus had been exhausted and it would not WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 16 of 361accept deferral for another year. Supporting the proposal to put the matter to a vote, Tuvalu noted it had 80 observers in its program and considered the matter one of human life and death."
WCPFC13,96,"Also supporting the proposal to put the matter to a vote, New Zealand noted the many participants who worked every available hour on this measure and made passionate and emotional statements supporting the need to take action."
WCPFC13,97,Fiji noted that it had come to WCPFC13 to adopt this issue. It saw no option but to support the suggestion to put it to a vote.
WCPFC13,98,"USA thanked the informal small working group chair, for her efforts in leading the informal small working group and to WWF for reminding participants of their humanity. This CCM recognised that until the Commission acted, they are just words."
WCPFC13,99,The Cook Islands respected and recognised the views put forward. Its preference was for consensus but would support a vote if that was the path taken.
WCPFC13,100,"Korea recognised the importance of the safety of observers at sea, which no CCM questioned, including fishing nations. Korea had focused mainly on the drafting and noted that no elements of the original draft had been taken out through negotiations. Korea recognised the frustration but was uncomfortable putting the matter to a vote rather than adopting by consensus."
WCPFC13,101,"China thanked the informal small working group chair, for her efforts and noted the importance of the issue. China had no difficulties with the provisions of the draft measure and could implement it. China noted that search and rescue continuing for 72 hours was a common practice in its national jurisdiction. It also noted that when China’s fishers went missing in Japanese waters, Japan does it too. China was uncomfortable going to a vote and hoped the measure could be adopted by consensus."
WCPFC13,102,"Tokelau considered all avenues to address this at TCC12, intersessionally, and at WCPFC13 were exhausted. FFA Ministers had stressed the importance of the work of observers in collecting data for compliance purposes. Tokelau noted that the Convention allows for a time for a vote to be fixed if it appeared “that all efforts to reach a decision by consensus have been exhausted”."
WCPFC13,103,RMI supported EU’s request to hear from Japan before considering the options exhausted.
WCPFC13,104,"Japan explained that it had received the proposal intersessionally from USA and after analysing it in detail concluded that not all of the provisions could be implemented within Japan’s current legal framework. Upon arriving in Fiji, the Japanese delegation started discussing these issues with other delegations and realized that these issues were much more serious than Japan had initially thought.  Consequently, Japan began the process of consulting with Tokyo for further instructions. Japan noted having limited flexibility and unless a clear instruction was received from Tokyo, Japan could not support the document. Japan recognised the situation was far from satisfactory and offered a number of commitments in a personal capacity. First, Japan could support if the document becomes a non-binding resolution. Second, Japan suggested that footnote one be amended to oblige Members to explain to TCC and WCPFC the reason for any non-implementation of provisions even though it is non-binding. Third, Japan would submit a detailed legal analysis to TCC13 on why it could not implement the provisions. This CCM also noted that Japan would come to WCPFC14 with a better position. Japan did not want the matter to go to a vote and noted that if that course was taken Japan would have to oppose. Japan’s head of delegation apologised to observers who have suffered and may suffer from the lack of a measure but stressed that this was the most he could offer.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 17 of 361"
WCPFC13,105,"The FFA Secretariat noted that as an observer provider, they knew they put individuals at risk each time they sent observers out to sea. If adopted, there would be an immediate improvement in observers’ conditions. The FFA Secretariat noted the amount of time and effort that had been devoted to the draft measure both within and outside the WCPFC processes. A meeting of coordinators had taken place. The FFA Fisheries Ministers had discussed the matter. TCC had discussed the draft. The USA had put in vast intersessional work. This work had been put in because of the preference for consensus. The FFA Secretariat took the view that there was no other way forward – the discussions had taken place and the drafting had been done. The Commission was urged to pick up the suggestion to take the matter to a vote."
WCPFC13,106,"The Chair enquired whether the alternative offered by Japan would offer CCMs any comfort. While China noted that it could go along with Japan’s suggestion, Tonga asked that a time be fixed for a vote. With the lack of possibility of reaching consensus on the draft measure for observer safety and the calls for a vote, the Chair fixed time for the vote to take place one hour later. However, just prior to the vote taking place, Japan advised that it had just received an instruction from Tokyo and could join the consensus to adopt the measure."
WCPFC13,107,The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-03 Conservation and Management Measure for the Protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Observers (Attachment F). Amending Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission
WCPFC13,108,"EU’s proposal to amend Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission was considered by SC12 and TCC12. EU explained that the intention of the amendment (WCPFC13-2016-DP04) was to facilitate the work of TCC – several data provision paragraphs were unclear and had required lengthy discussions in TCC. In the end these were inconclusive and certain obligations were not able to be assessed. EU noted that significant progress had been made in agreeing several of the proposed amendments through the sub-committees. Two issues remained outstanding for further discussion by the Commission – the obligation to provide operational data and addressing situations where CCMs are assessed as non-compliant because information from observer providers has not been provided to SPC in a timely manner. Regarding the first issue, EU stated an intention to capture the obligation to provide data to the Commission rather than through bilateral agreements with SPC. EU noted there was no consensus on this point, or the second point."
WCPFC13,109,China highlighted a difficulty it had with a proposed change from “should” to “shall” which changed the legal status of the document.
WCPFC13,110,Japan noted that it had signed an MOU with SPC to provide operational data while complying with a domestic requirement for confidentiality. Japan stated that this was the only way it could currently provide operational data and thus did not support the proposed amendment to rules for operational data submission.
WCPFC13,111,"Indonesia understood the importance of the Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission, noting that Indonesia was developing a harvest strategy in its archipelagic waters which will rely on good data. Indonesia’s fisheries are complex, multi-species, multi-gear and small scale fisheries. The Indonesian fleet did not currently operate in the high seas and Indonesia was fully committed to providing the data but still faced difficulties complying with the CMM. Its intention was to try and comply. It was also noted that the proposed change from “should” to “shall” would impact Indonesia.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 18 of 361"
WCPFC13,112,"RMI made a general comment about proposals needing to engage with CMM 2013-06, which the EU proposal had done. RMI fully supported the intent of EU’s proposal and looked forward to its agreement, noting data provision was an ongoing issue for the Commission."
WCPFC13,113,USA looked forward to the proposal’s adoption and had provided comments it hoped would be taken into account.
WCPFC13,114,"On the basis of comments received from FFA and consultations with those CCMs with concerns, EU submitted a revised version of the proposal on 9 December (WCPFC13-2016-DP04_rev1)."
WCPFC13,115,USA and China noted that their comments had been taken on board and they could support the proposal.
WCPFC13,116,CNMI sought to clarify the scientific name of striped marlin on page one of Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission (Kajikia audax) and queried the correct scientific name for Pacific Bluefin tuna.
WCPFC13,117,"EU clarified that broader text would not be amended by the EU proposal, which was only concerned with the obligation to provide data. EU suggested that SC could be asked to look at an update to the nomenclature if necessary."
WCPFC13,118,"Indonesia commented that it would try its best to satisfy all the requirements to provide data but needed to strengthen its observer programs, starting next year. Indonesia was sure it would not be able to fulfil these obligations in 2017 and requested time to be able to do so. But it did not object to adoption of the proposal as it understood the role good data played in supporting the stock assessments."
WCPFC13,119,EU clarified that it was not intending to create new obligations with the proposed amendments.
WCPFC13,120,Japan noted that once the amendments were adopted they were mandatory and suggested Indonesia needed some arrangements so that this CCM will not be assessed as non-compliant on the new requirement until the capacity building program is completed.
WCPFC13,121,The Chair noted that Indonesia may not be ready to meet the obligations until later in 2017 and adoption with a footnote providing additional time for Indonesia could be considered. The length of time would need to be discussed.
WCPFC13,122,"In response to Japan’s request, the WCPFC Compliance Manager, Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, clarified that decisions of the Commission become binding 60 days after end of commission meeting, unless there is a time delay built into a CMM or decision. When the obligations would be assessed for compliance purposes was a different matter."
WCPFC13,123,"With Japan and China offering helpful clarifying comments, the Chair confirmed that compliance against the revised measure would be assessed from 2018, not 2017 and asked if this could satisfy Indonesia on data collection."
WCPFC13,124,"Indonesia noted that its operational data will be available to the Commission from 2025 and EEZ data is gathered from its observer program. Based on its experience with port sampling data, Indonesia considered it could probably provide the data from those programs for 2018 but maybe not all required data, for example discard data and size data. Indonesia would train observers to do it correctly. It would not be easy for Indonesia to fulfil its obligations. Indonesia would try its best to submit the data in 2018 but could not guarantee it would meet the standard for SPC or the Commission. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 19 of 361"
WCPFC13,125,"The Chair suggested that the Commission could adopt the proposal, noting Indonesia’s difficulties, or adopt the measure with a caveat outlining Indonesia’s implementation schedule."
WCPFC13,126,Japan proposed that the Commission adopt the proposal and offered to assist Indonesia draft some language to put to the Commission reflecting Indonesia’s concerns on the submission of data.
WCPFC13,127,The Commission agreed to adopt the revised “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission” decision (Attachment G).
WCPFC13,128,The Commission agreed that the following text from Indonesia could be recorded as report language in relation to decision on WCPFC13-2016-DP04_rev1 on Scientific Data to be provided amendment: “WCPFC13 agreed that there is a technical difficulty for Indonesia to fulfil new request such as provision of discard data until the capacity building program including the data collection system is completed.” Proposed Terms for a review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC13,129,"Introducing WCPFC13-2016-24, the WCPFC Compliance Manager noted that TCC had tasked the Secretariat with preparing a revised TOR for the review of the CMS for the Commission’s consideration (paragraph 139, TCC12 Summary Report). A number of comments had been received from CCMs, including WCPFC13-2016-DP12 which had been considered in the development of WCPFC13-2016-24 and more recently WCPFC13-2016-DP29 from FFA members. There were outstanding questions for the Commission about whether the review should take place in 2017 or 2018, and budgetary implications of the review which the FAC was awaiting guidance on. Regardless of whether the Commission decides the review should be undertaken in 2017 or 2018, a review panel will need to be appointed and a timeline drawn up. The input of members would be sought, a selection process outlined, and the Executive Director would appoint a panel. The WCPFC Compliance Manager noted this would ideally happen in April or May – it was proposed that the reviewers would travel to Pohnpei to meet with the Secretariat and FSM, as a representative of CCMs, for discussions to guide their work. The panel would attend TCC in September to observe the process. In December, the Chair of the review panel would attend the annual Commission meeting and provide a progress report which would be due in March the following year. This report would be sent to members for consideration through that next year. Depending on the outcome of the observer participation discussions, confidentiality arrangements for the review panel may need to be further considered, although it was noted that consultants are subject to contracts including confidentiality clauses which have been sufficient in the past. The WCPFC Compliance Manager noted that the Commission would need to consider an interim arrangement following the end of the current CMS measure, to cover the review period. Options in the terms of reference reflect that need. The working paper also contained an indicative budget."
WCPFC13,130,"Japan supported the basic concept of a review but noted its USD $124,000 indicative budget. This CCM commented that several other proposals on the agenda had budgetary implications and something might have to be dropped. Japan reserved the right to come back to this. Japan also asked about the relationship between WCPFC13-2016-DP29 and WCPFC13-2016-DP12."
WCPFC13,131,"FFA members thanked the Secretariat for incorporating most of its suggestions in WCPFC13-2016-DP12 but one specific comment was not included, relating to whether the CMS process is procedurally fair, and produces fair and reasonable outcomes. For these CCMs, this was a critical part of this review and must be reflected into the terms of reference. The review should include all three principles outlined in WCPFC13-2016-DP12 – effectiveness, efficiency and fairness. FFA members did not support pushing the review out another year and supported the proposed schedule and adoption of a WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 20 of 361clear process at WCPFC13. These CCMs supported a review panel with at least three consultants. It was noted that the terms of reference included consideration of mechanisms to respond to non-compliance. These CCMs were interested in experiences and practices elsewhere that would inform the future work of the Commission and reiterated their longstanding position that the CMS should provide the right balance between supporting CCMs, particularly in respect of developing States, and punitive or other remedial actions in response to specific forms of non-compliance."
WCPFC13,132,"China’s concern centred on what constituted “independent”, hoping that “Commission” expert could be used instead in the terms of reference. China commented that panel members should come from its part of the region, and noted this could make it more difficult to select people. China asked for confirmation whether or not the Commission made a decision to establish the panel, noting Japan’s suggestion to hold the issue open."
WCPFC13,133,"In response to a query about the methodology around selection of the experts, the WCPFC Compliance Manager suggested that a WCPFC Circular would be prepared requesting nominations. Once a list of nominations was compiled, Commission members would assist the Secretariat to priority-rank them."
WCPFC13,134,"EU noted that FFA members’ comments went well beyond what was agreed and what an independent panel reviewing a CMS should be tasked with. EU considered the review should focus on the efficiency of the process and whether adequate resources were allocated, whereas FFA’s comments were more in line with a performance review, which would look at all aspects of the organisation."
WCPFC13,135,"USA agreed with FFA members that the review should encompass the whole CMS over the last 6 years, although USA wanted more time to consider other aspects of the FFA proposal. Regarding the timing of the review, revisions in the new measure were intended to directly address procedural and fairness issues; therefore, there would be benefit to allowing the current measure to run another year and in the review taking place in 2018 rather than 2017. The TCC Chair noted that TCC had experienced growing pains this year in working with the new measure, but expected improvement next year."
WCPFC13,136,"The Chair noted there were still drafting and conceptual issues to address. An informal small working group was formed to undertake further discussions, led by New Zealand. On 9 December, New Zealand advised that the informal small working group was close to resolution on the terms but needed more time for discussions."
WCPFC13,137,"EU did not object to looking at the CMS in detail, but preferred it be part of a wider exercise reviewing not just compliance but the whole functioning of WCPFC, including the challenges of resourcing the Commission faces. It considered that this was an appropriate time to have a performance review and the analysis of the CMS should be part of this. However, despite its hesitations, the EU did not oppose consensus."
WCPFC13,138,"Considering this a lower priority than other matters, Japan recalled earlier discussions about looking at the proposed audit as part of the whole budget. Japan was not willing to support the project at this point, and would raise its concerns in FAC."
WCPFC13,139,"New Zealand noted the good, constructive discussions in the working group and advised that the findings of the CMS audit will be considered in the next Commission performance review, indeed would assist to streamline it. New Zealand noted that the audit was a priority for SIDS. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 21 of 361"
WCPFC13,140,"Later on 9 December, the Chair noted that FAC was waiting for a decision on the review before it could finalising the allocation of funds for 2017 and clarified that funds were available for the audit."
WCPFC13,141,"With Japan commenting that it was still not convinced of the need to spend USD $124,000 on the project, New Zealand and Japan worked together in the margins to come up with a final text. New Zealand advised that a number of compromises had been made in the margins relating to the timing of the review and the composition of the panel and the terms of reference could now be agreed. Japan was then able to join the consensus on the review. (WCPFC13-2016-24_rev1)"
WCPFC13,142,The Commission approved the Terms for the Independent Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme which is to occur in 2017 (Attachment H). List of obligations to be assessed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC13,143,"USA introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP20, a list of obligations to be assessed by the CMS, noting an FFA suggestion had been the inclusion of an assessment against the provisions of paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06, the CMM on criteria for the consideration of conservation and management proposals. USA noted that the Commission would need to give the Secretariat clear guidance about how to make such an assessment, since it is an obligation for the Commission as a whole, not for individual CCMs. USA noted that New Zealand recommended that all CMMs that are amended be automatically scheduled for review during the first TCC session that occurs after the amendment.  The only such amended CMM relevant for review in 2016-2018 (i.e. those scheduled to be reviewed less often than every year) is the seabird measure, and USA shifted its review schedule in this proposal accordingly.  USA highlighted New Zealand’s broader proposal for the Commission to consider when it updates the assessment schedule for future years.  USA also reported some discussions about overlap area notifications. USA advised that work was continuing in the margins and CCMs were still commenting on the list; a new version would be prepared."
WCPFC13,144,"On 9 December, USA referred the meeting to WCPFC13-2016-DP20_rev1, noting that there were some outstanding comments to be discussed in plenary, including the suggestion from FFA members that paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06, relating to evaluating the impact of proposals on SIDS and territories, should be included in the list. USA took the view that it was an obligation on the Commission as a whole, not individual CCMs. A second issue was a suggestion from Japan that the full utilisation of sharks (paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07) be assessed every year rather than every second year. Thirdly, PNA suggested changes in assessing paragraph 20 of the tropical tuna measure relating to limits in-zone and paragraph 24 not being assessed in 2017. USA advised that it had not revised the measure to accommodate those suggestions."
WCPFC13,145,"Japan stated that the review of paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 should be conducted every year. Regarding CMM 2013-06, Japan considered that this should be reviewed when a CCM puts a proposal forward, rather than assessed at TCC and had difficulty accepting the inclusion of CMM 2013-06."
WCPFC13,146,EU raised concerns about the deletion from the list of paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 being assessed annually. EU noted there even if there was an issue with provision of information it was nevertheless important to continue assessing this measure annually.
WCPFC13,147,New Zealand made a general recommendation that any measures that are amended by the Commission should be assessed at the next TCC.
WCPFC13,148,USA noted this would need to be the subsequent TCC so any amendment had a full year of being in effect before being assessed. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 22 of 361
WCPFC13,149,"From RMI’s point of view, CMM 2013-06 was a Commission measure that should be strictly adhered to. It includes a checklist which calls for a consultative process about needs and capacity building for SIDS to be able to adhere to any new proposal. RMI noted that the measure was the operationalisation of Article 30 of the Convention and if the Commission does not take SIDS’ interests into account they may be cut off from full engagement and effective participation."
WCPFC13,150,"EU considered CMM 2013-06 to be a little different from other measures in terms of what the exact obligation is. For EU, each proposal needed to analyse whether it constitutes a disproportionate burden on SIDS, but it was not a compliance issue. When a proponent submits a new proposal, the Commission examines whether it satisfies the requirement and, if not, the measure would not be considered/adopted but it is not that the proponent would be considered non-compliant."
WCPFC13,151,"USA noted that these issues were reflected in the draft proposal except that relating to CMM 2013-06, which was reflected on page 14. USA also considered that CMM 2013-06 put obligations on the Commission. The provision did not place an obligation on specific CCMs, so it would be difficult for TCC to assess it and for the Secretariat to provide information for them to do so. The Commission could choose at some point to revise the measure."
WCPFC13,152,"Later on 9 December, USA advised it had consulted with interested CCMs and there was agreement. However, the draft had become so complicated with track changes that USA instead produced draft decision language regarding WCPFC13-2016-DP20_rev1 in the form of a set of instructions for the Secretariat to prepare a revised document after the meeting."
WCPFC13,153,"The Commission also agreed to a request from Japan, supported by the EU, relating to paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 on sharks to amend the frequency of assessment changing from every two years to each year."
WCPFC13,154,"The instructions to amend DP20_rev1 that were subsequently agreed by the Commission on-screen were:   Regarding CMM 2013-06: Page 7 (frequency of assessment): Delete bracketed row for CMM 2013-06 Page 14 (2017 review): Delete two bracketed rows for CMM 2013-06 Page 19 (2018 review): Delete two bracketed rows for CMM 2013-06  Regarding CMM 2015-01: Page 15 (2017 review): For CMM 2015-01, para 20, change category from “i” to “collective” Page 15 (2017 review): Add row for CMM 2015-01, para 24, with category “collective” Page 20 (2018 review): For CMM 2015-01, para 20, change category from “i” to “collective” Regarding CMM 2010-07: Table 1 – increase CMM 2010-07 frequency from 2 years to every year 2017 review: for CMM 2010-07 include para 6 2018 review: for CMM 2010-07 include para 6"
WCPFC13,155,"Regarding the list of obligations to be assessed, the FFA members expressed concern over the lack of inclusion of paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06, which relates to the impacts of new proposals on SIDS and territories. Other CCMs agreed that the provisions of that paragraph are very important, and that the Commission should assess its implementation. However, as currently worded, the obligation is placed on the Commission rather than on the proponents of new proposals, so it might be difficult for the TCC to review compliance in the context of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS). WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 23 of 361"
WCPFC13,156,"The Commission agreed that as stated in the measure, it has an obligation to apply these questions in considering new proposals; and that it will continue to do so using the current practice of having this task undertaken by the specific proponents in order to inform the Commission’s consideration."
WCPFC13,157,"The Commission also agreed that at its annual session in 2017, it would review paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06 and consider possible amendments to facilitate assessment of its implementation in the CMS."
WCPFC13,158,The Commission adopted the updated list of obligations to be assessed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (Attachment I). Proposal to amend Charter Notification Scheme (CMM 2015-05)
WCPFC13,159,"On 9 December, Japan introduced its proposal to amend the charter notification scheme (WCPFC13-2016-DP25_rev2). Japan had revised its first version after consultations with several members. The most significant revision was to paragraph 7, clarifying which party should report catch and effort to the Executive Director. CCMs wished to see the draft in writing. Japan advised shortly afterwards that the USA had proposed a paragraph to replace paragraph 7 in DP25_rev2. It would give reporting obligations to chartering states. Some further drafting took place in plenary which was circulated to the meeting as DP25_rev3 late on 9 December so that CCMs could see the draft in writing."
WCPFC13,160,"In response to a query from RMI about whether attribution related to catch and effort, USA confirmed that it had wanted a reference to reporting requirements under Commission decisions. This meant the attribution of catch and effort in the data submission and in Annual Reports Part 1 and 2."
WCPFC13,161,"Without consensus for USA’s proposed amendment of paragraph 7, Japan suggested reverting to the previous version for adoption. Some further drafting took place in plenary and there were no objections to the changes made onscreen."
WCPFC13,162,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-05 Conservation and Management Measure on the Charter Notification Scheme (Attachment J), which will replace CMM 2015-05. High Seas Special Management Areas"
WCPFC13,163,"FFA members introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP14, a proposed CMM for the special management of certain high seas areas. If adopted, the measure would prohibit transhipment in the Eastern High Seas Pocket (EHSP) Special Management Area that was created in CMM 2010-02, and extend the same conditions to five fully- or semi-enclosed areas of high seas adjacent to FFA member EEZs. It was noted that these areas are either difficult or impossible to access except by going through the surrounding EEZs. Currently, foreign fishing vessels and carriers are not obliged to report their entry or exit to most of these EEZs if they are not licenced to also fish in them, which complicates monitoring and increases the risk of IUU fishing in EEZ waters. FFA members reiterated their concern about longline vessels transhipping to carriers on the high seas and noted that the Commission had not been able to agree that high seas purse-seine transhipment should be prohibited, particularly in areas distant from port. These CCMs considered the high seas pockets to be a special case, with a unique status under the Convention which provides that “special attention” be paid to compatibility between CMMs and national measures established in EEZs for the same stocks. FFA members took the view that it is practicable to prohibit transhipment in these limited areas. For FFA members, coordinating the management of high seas fishing is one of WCPFC’s priority responsibilities. They can cooperate WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 24 of 361among themselves in the sustainable management and conservation of fish stocks in their EEZs, but only the Commission can deal effectively with high seas fishing."
WCPFC13,164,"Japan had some fundamental problems with the proposal. This CCM did not understand the logic of prohibiting high seas at-sea transhipment, noting that transhipment activity on the high seas is well monitored by observers. Japan advised it had difficulty accepting the prohibition and suggested there were other ways to monitor possible illegal transhipments. Japan felt there should be greater utilisation of FFA Surveillance Centre’s state of the art VMS technology to detect illegal at-sea transhipment, noting that it had raised the same subject at TCC. A Japanese delegate had visited the Surveillance Centre and been impressed with the technology. This would show when two vessels were floating side by side and might be engaging in high seas transhipment. With communications between the Surveillance Centre and the Secretariat, flag states can be requested to check what the fishing vessels are doing. Japan thought the proposal would increase the workload of fishery managers tremendously, including Japan’s, by introducing reporting obligations for entry and exit of these areas. As long as a VMS signal is available, Japan did not see the need for the measure."
WCPFC13,165,"Chinese Taipei could not support the proposal, noting there was a monitoring scheme to monitor high seas transhipment and carrier vessels have observers on board and coastal states can assess VMS data as per the Commission’s data rules."
WCPFC13,166,"China thanked FFA for including the map in the proposal, highlighting the five pockets. China noted that all the high seas areas were surrounded by national jurisdiction. This CCM supported Japan’s intervention that a transhipment ban in the many high seas pockets was not needed for the time being, with the exception of the EHSP. For China, a ban on transhipment in the EHSP could be supported as the EHSP had been a special area for six years."
WCPFC13,167,"EU supported the proposal, noting that each year it comments that the exception has become the norm regarding transhipment. EU wanted a ban on high seas transhipment. While it was not necessarily a source of IUU fishing, the practice has a high risk of being an occasion for irregular activities and as such should be avoided as much as possible. EU noted that its fleet does not tranship on the high seas, despite the costs this imposed on the vessels."
WCPFC13,168,"Korea noted that its vessels do not tranship in the high seas pockets but noted the fundamental concern of others. While recognising the FFA’s concerns, Korea could not support further burden being placed on its longline fleet by requiring vessels to report their entry into and departure from high seas pockets, noting the Flick the Switch arrangement was already in place."
WCPFC13,169,"The FFA Secretariat noted that the WCPFC VMS data to which the FFA Surveillance Centre has access is limited. It is only in respect of FFA members that have allowed the data to be viewed. FFA cannot provide full surveillance of the high seas areas, though if high seas VMS data could be provided, member CCMs would certainly welcome it."
WCPFC13,170,"The Chair noted that the Commission had discussed the issue of high seas pocket transhipment in many forms. The Chair noted the willingness to move forward on the issue of the high seas pockets and transhipment, and expected the discussion to continue in the future.  Port based initiatives"
WCPFC13,171,"FFA members introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP15, a proposal for port-based initiatives to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. FFA members thanked CCMs that had encouraged them to submit the proposal as the stepping stone towards the Commission developing port-based MCS arrangements WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 25 of 361in the region. For FFA members, maintaining their sovereignty was fundamental in the development of such measures. The proposal was compatible with the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and was a non-threatening foundation for the Commission to build MCS networks upon. The FFA proposal aimed to provide a mechanism for CCMs to volunteer their ports to be used for inspection purposes, and establish a cooperative means for CCMs to seek the assistance of port states in the WCPO to deal with vessels believed to have engaged in IUU fishing. It aimed to provide port states with the flexibility to determine whether they are able to assist other CCMs in requests for inspections, determining which port inspections might be undertaken, and assisting those port states that aspire to strengthen their port inspection regimes. FFA members were undertaking several initiatives towards strengthening port state arrangements and thanked WWF for its support developing the port inspector electronic reporting system. A port state measures gap analysis was underway, assisted by The Pew Charitable Trusts funding. FFA members thanked New Zealand for establishing a five-year programme to develop and enhance port state measures in FFA member countries, which will provide the resources and support to establish regulatory frameworks and operational tools to fight IUU fishing."
WCPFC13,172,"No discussions took place directly on this proposal, in light of there being two port state measures proposals submitted to WCPFC13. Subsequent discussions around the EU proposal on a WCPFC scheme for minimum standards for inspection in port (below) dealt with both proposals.  Port Inspection Minimum Standards"
WCPFC13,173,"EU introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP03, a proposal to implement port inspection minimum standards. EU considered it important for the Commission to equip itself with port state measures – an essential tool to fight IUU fishing. EU noted the FFA proposal did not have the same standards as the FAO Port State Measures Agreement, but it was a good first step. The Chair proposed discussing both proposals, then EU and FFA could work together to bring something back to plenary."
WCPFC13,174,"Chinese Taipei expressed its willingness to exert effort and fulfil responsibility as a port state and flag state, in support of the Port State Measures Agreement that came into force in June 5 this year.  This CCM had technical amendments to discuss with both FFA and EU for the adoption of a WCPFC port state measure."
WCPFC13,175,"USA continued to support port state measures in WCPFC, noting adoption of one of the proposals was an important first step and did not have to be the only step taken."
WCPFC13,176,"China noted a provision in the FFA proposal where if a CCM does not designate a port where a CCM has the resources to undertake inspections the requirements in the measure would not apply. China said this would give it flexibility, as it will not be ready to conduct port inspections for a couple of years. Later, China can designate ports to do so. China hoped this aspect would be retained in any measure which comes back to plenary for adoption."
WCPFC13,177,"FFA members confirmed that the intention was to allow an opt-in mechanism, which would also help FFA members that are developing their capacities in this area."
WCPFC13,178,"On 9 December, FFA Secretariat advised that it had worked in the margins on a revised version, which had been made available for CCMs the previous night. It was noted that positive support had been received from many CCMs, including some with previous concerns. EU advised that it had worked constructively with FFA, despite FFA’s proposal not being as ambitious, it was a welcome step in the right direction and for this reason it agreed that discussion should focus on FFA proposal which had integrated some of EU's concerns. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 26 of 361"
WCPFC13,179,China confirmed that the paragraph 4 had accommodated its concern.
WCPFC13,180,"Japan could not support the document at WCPFC13 as it had not had enough time to analyse it. Japan noted that port measures have bigger, delicate issues that needed to be taken into account."
WCPFC13,181,The Chair commented that there was no consensus to adopt port state measures at WCPFC13 but noted the discussions and the latest thinking which was contained in the FFA proposal in its revised form (WCPFC13-2016-DP15_rev1).
WCPFC13,182,"New Zealand thanked China for its constructive engagement, and noted that the Commission had made significant progress on port state measures in the last few years. New Zealand noted that CCMs could opt-in to the measure."
WCPFC13,183,Japan noted that it was conducting legal analysis of the FAO Port State Measures Agreement in considering the ratification and the timing was very delicate to be considering anything which deviates from that agreement’s provisions. Japan hoped it would be able to come to the Commission meeting next year with a much better. Port Coordinators Program
WCPFC13,184,"TCC12 (paragraphs 179-181) had recommended the continuation of the Port Coordinators Program and identification of a funding source. The trial programme commenced in 2015 following its establishment by WCPFC11 decision, and was in its second and final year, pending a decision on continuation by the Commission. The reference doc for this agenda item was WCPFC13-2016-26."
WCPFC13,185,"EU had welcomed the Port Coordinators initiative from the beginning as it helped build the necessary capacity for port inspection controls. However, EU expressed some concerns about the results of the trial, noting that of the three FFA members supported, only two succinct statements, without supporting data, were provided to the Commission. EU noted that SPC considered the program useful for data collection and asked for some additional information on this, including the situation before the trial and the additional data collected with the trial. EU still considered the initiative useful but wanted to better understand the program’s contribution and impact before agreeing to make it permanent. EU could support continuing the program for another year, with better reporting to be provided."
WCPFC13,186,"PNG, one of the recipient CCMs, noted it had not provided a report. PNG had participated to gauge whether the program would assist with capacity constraints at the port level. It had identified gaps and recruited a coordinator, but noted that if reporting requirements were to become burdensome and the distinction between Commission business and national business became unclear, PNG may not continue to participate."
WCPFC13,187,"Japan supported the concept of Port Coordinators in principle, as they contributed to preventing or detecting IUU activities. This CCM wanted to see the impact on the budget before a decision was made to support the continuation. Japan supported obligations to report on the activities and the establishment of terms of reference and some kind of template for reporting the activities of the Port Coordinators."
WCPFC13,188,"The Chair queried whether, based on PNG and EU’s comments, CCMs supported an additional year of the program, with budget discussions still to weigh up all the Commission’s priorities. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 27 of 361"
WCPFC13,189,"FFA members thanked the Secretariat and SPC for providing support and technical assistance for the trial programme. These CCMs considered it to be an effective mechanism with tangible outputs – building the capacity of those who implement the scientific and MCS programmes that feed in to the work of the Commission. FFA members supported the proposal to continue the programme, and noted the changes to the proposed terms of reference that address some of the administrative issues experienced over the trial period. It was noted that some CCMs originally intended to be part of the trial programme had been able to fund Port Coordinator positions domestically and did not participate in the trial. This meant others could have and the ability for CCMs to indicate their interest in the programme was a good addition to the terms of reference. FFA members considered it imperative that the determination of the Port Coordinator’s tasks remain with the head of the respective national fisheries agency, to ensure the position supplements the needs of the individual national monitoring programme. These CCMs hoped other CCMs saw benefit in this initiative and the Commission would extend the programme."
WCPFC13,190,"USA was conditionally prepared to move forward with the extension and expansion of the program, noting it required resources and there were many demands on the Commission’s resources. USA noted that FAC needed to consider the budget and advise if the resources were available before it could make a firm decision. As other CCMs were, USA was concerned about the lack of documentation on the benefits of the program for recipient countries and the Commission."
WCPFC13,191,"FSM expressed its appreciation to the Commission and those CCMs that supported the project, reporting that it had worked closely with the Secretariat and SPC for two years. Like PNG, FSM joined the project as a means to augment data collection. It was originally intended that it would be beneficial for Port Coordinators to be in the busiest ports in the region. FSM noted that the Secretariat was looking at means to provide capacity assistance in ports that want to improve their data collection activities; this was part of the WCPFC budget. FSM had benefitted significantly from the programme, allowing it to maintain personnel to do the work and collect the data. FSM noted it was already overburdened with reporting but had submitted the necessary reports. FSM was reassessing the continuation of national level data collection efforts that serve FSM’s national purposes and requirements imposed through WCPFC measures. FSM supported the extension and would take a back seat while it did this."
WCPFC13,192,Kiribati noted it had benefitted greatly from the programme and supported its extension.
WCPFC13,193,"Chinese Taipei supported an additional year, considering it a very important MCS component and assistance to SIDS. This CCM asked recipient countries to provide reporting which demonstrates the benefits and progress of the trial."
WCPFC13,194,"RMI noted that the Marshall Islands port is one of the busiest though RMI does not participate in the programme. PNG and EU had noted the lack of a standard developed for this work, noting that there was nothing to be assessed against. Provision of operational data remained an issue for RMI, and supported USA’s suggestion to develop a standard. An option was to develop the standards before committing the funding and rolling it over on a long term basis. RMI considered there to be more to do, and there were still some questions about the trial."
WCPFC13,195,The Chair asked whether the question was only of funding or whether more fundamental work needed to be done.
WCPFC13,196,"In response, RMI preferred tasking TCC with reviewing a set of standards regarding the Port Coordinators’ work rather than asking FAC to look for funding yet. RMI suggested that the work of the last two years including the original TORs be the starting point. And Japan supported asking TCC WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 28 of 361to develop standards, hoping the Commission would also request the Secretariat to develop a draft common format related to reporting, to also be discussed at TCC."
WCPFC13,197,The Commission noted the report of the WCPFC Port Coordinators Programme Trial 2015–2016 (WCPFC13-2016-26) and tasked TCC13 to further consider the recommendations to extend the Port Coordinators Programme. Proposal to amend CMM 2010-02
WCPFC13,198,"The Cook Islands introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP02_rev1, a proposal to ban transhipment in the EHSP. Cook Islands noted that China had joined the proposal. It had been revised to include comments submitted by other distant water fishing states and a revised version was available. Cook Islands noted that in 2010 the EHSP was designated as an SMA. The EHSP is located in the middle of an albacore tuna fishery and is surrounded by Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Kiribati. Since the adoption of the EHSP SMA measure, Cook Islands played an active role in monitoring the area, with regular joint patrols with France and New Zealand, bilateral operations with Kiribati and trilateral operations with Samoa and Tonga. Cook Islands advised that vessels were still not adhering to the required reporting, allowing illegal activities to potentially take place. There was a two-year timeframe for adoption of the ban which gave operators time to prepare. Noting concerns raised at WCPFC13 about the encroachment of rights to high seas areas, Cook Islands clarified that its proposal only applied to the EHSP."
WCPFC13,199,"On 9 December, Korea and Japan advised that they could support the revised version, while stressing that its acceptance of the EHSP measure did not constitute a precedent. Chinese Taipei shared the views of previous speakers and also supported the proposal."
WCPFC13,200,"Cook Islands noted the significance of the measure in improving management on the high seas, and the co-sponsorship of China was a small step towards greater coordination and cooperation between coastal states and distant water fishing states in the WCPO."
WCPFC13,201,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-02 Conservation and Management Measure for the Eastern High Seas Pocket (Attachment K), which will replace CMM 2010-02. Fisheries and Access Agreement Information"
WCPFC13,202,"EU introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP05, a proposal for a CMM relating to information on fisheries access agreements. Noting that each year it puts forward similar proposals, EU recalled that in 2016 the Review Conference on the UN Fish Stocks Agreement was attended by members of the Commission. The Conference adopted by consensus, so with the support of all WCPFC members, a resolution that encouraged greater transparency and strengthened the fight against IUU including by making fisheries access agreements publicly available, subject to confidentiality requirements. This was why EU had again submitted a proposal for transparency in fisheries access agreements. The proposal took into account the Conference-agreed requirement that all information provided shall be in line with domestic confidentiality requirements."
WCPFC13,203,"FFA members did not support the proposal. They explained that they did not fear transparency, which they provided in many ways including through the provision of operational data on all the tuna fishing that occurs within their EEZs and publicly available laws and Harmonized Minimum Terms and Conditions which set out access requirements. These CCMs considered the proposal to be anti-competitive, and noted the history of distant water fishing states using economic and political power to protect the commercial interests of their fleets and undermining the interests of SIDS. This proposal WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 29 of 361would strengthen the position of distant water fleets in bidding for commercial access to FFA member waters, particularly for those FFA members with or developing competitive tender processes. This would not be consistent with the obligation to recognise the special requirements of developing states."
WCPFC13,204,"USA supported the proposal, noting that greater transparency was important to the successful management of fisheries in the WCPO. USA noted that if it could not be adopted, USA hoped there would be movement on increasing transparency through another mechanism."
WCPFC13,205,"EU noted that in the UN forum some FFA members agreed to transparency and making agreements publicly available, but in the Commission they could not."
WCPFC13,206,"The Chair noted the repetitive discussions around this issue over the years and the Commission was still not close to consensus. She asked that those with the most interest and those with the most difficulties craft an alternative to meet the objective everyone shares, taking on board the stated concerns. AGENDA ITEM 6 — WCPFC IUU VESSEL LIST"
WCPFC13,207,"WCPFC13-2016-10_rev1 prepared by the Secretariat provides the relevant information, including recommendations from TCC12 related to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC13,208,"Cook Islands reported that it had come to an amicable conclusion with Vanuatu about the vessel ESSIEN 108, which TCC12 had provisionally nominated for the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, and the vessel could be removed from the provisional list. With no new vessels to be listed, the Commission accepted the TCC12 recommendation that the three vessels on the current WCPFC IUU Vessel List remain on it. It was noted that these vessels had been on the list for some years."
WCPFC13,209,"FFA members considered it of grave concern that the three vessels had been on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for several years, compounded by their appearance on other RFMOs’ IUU lists. With it clear that the operators of these vessels are disregarding fisheries regulatory frameworks, FFA members thanked the Executive Director for writing to flag States and RFMOs to attempt to locate these vessels. With no further information about these vessels, FFA reiterated that the Commission needs to be more innovative and collect information on the operators of these rogue vessels. To this end, FFA members suggested at TCC that the name of the master be included alongside the vessels on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and support the subsequent TCC12 recommendation as a key step towards locating the perpetrators."
WCPFC13,210,"Regarding YU FONG 168, FFA members noted that it has been on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for seven years, and the flag state cannot locate the vessel. The last advice from the flag state Chinese Taipei was that through a notification by Thailand to IOTC this vessel was last known to have landed catch in Thailand in 2013. The vessel was listed on the IOTC IUU List in May 2015. RMI noted Chinese Taipei’s previous advice that the vessel’s licence was revoked in 2009 and the owner of the vessel has been penalised through repeated monetary punishment for violating the rules of not returning to port. FFA members asked for further information from the flag state about additional steps that may have been taken to locate and prosecute the operator. FFA members did not want vessels ‘parked’ in the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and advocated effort from all angles. These CCMs supported the Executive Director continuing to reach out to RFMOs for any more information on these vessels and owners. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 30 of 361"
WCPFC13,211,"Chinese Taipei noted that the YU FONG 168 had absconded in 2008 without coming to port and confirmed it was placed on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List in 2009. Acting alone, Chinese Taipei could not resolve the issue. This CCM noted that WCPFC was a platform for international cooperation and, as the vessel may be being protected by another country, a system for all CCMs to act was needed. Chinese Taipei reported that in 2016 it had adopted new deep sea fisheries legislation, which allowed for stronger measures to be taken against vessel owners."
WCPFC13,212,"FFA members noted that the Commission RFV includes the nationality of the master and requested that the master’s nationality be included alongside the master’s name on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. For vessels not on the RFV, FFA members requested that the flag state bear the responsibility of providing the name and nationality of the master by TCC13, for inclusion on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. FFA members flagged that they are looking into Persons of Interest, which will link unique identification details, such as passport details, to each master’s name and nationality. In doing so, FFA members would not just target vessels involved in IUU activities but the operator, and bring them to justice."
WCPFC13,213,"FFA members noted their concern about the number of recent incidents involving Vietnamese small scale boats conducting unauthorised fishing in FFA member waters, targeting beche de mer and other coastal species not directly under the purview of the Commission. These CCMs noted that these IUU activities significantly impacted the marine environment of coastal states and can affect the livelihoods of small island communities. Other impacts included additional costs imposed on states in taking action against these vessels. FFA members called on Vietnam to fulfil its flag state responsibilities in controlling these vessels and in cooperating directly when they are detected and apprehended."
WCPFC13,214,"FSM noted that in the past two years it has arrested nine illegal blue fishing boats, with approximately 135 fishermen. FSM has now categorized combating IUU fishing as a national priority, but noted the costs are high. FSM spent USD $200,000 on fuel alone this year. Other costs include salaries for maritime officers, prosecution costs and costs of detention. None of the blue boats were registered to fish in FSM’s waters, had transponders or were detectable on VMS. FSM government officials had met with Vietnamese officials but in FSM’s view Vietnam has not demonstrated concrete measures to address the issue. FSM asked Vietnam what action it had taken as a flag state against vessels violating its laws noting that some of the vessels had returned to FSM waters two or three times despite being arrested. FSM noted that IUU fishing in the Pacific undermines the rights of coastal states to regulate marine resources, resulting in the loss of national revenue and employment opportunities and impacting Pacific Islanders who depend on the oceans as a source of nutrition. It is a risk to the marine environment, threatens fish stocks, devalues fisheries and disadvantages those who abide by regional and national rules. FSM sought the Commission’s assistance in responding and called on flag states to combat IUU fishing."
WCPFC13,215,"Vietnam recognised it was a very important issue, but emphasised that the Vietnamese IUU vessels were not tuna vessels and were not targeting tuna. In 2015 Vietnam sent an official to FSM for high level meetings and set up a hotline to the FSM government. Vietnam was in the process of revising its laws to ensure nationals paid a high penalty for IUU activities."
WCPFC13,216,"PNG noted that despite being on the list for some years, no one had reported finding YU FONG 168. PNG asked whether the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels is cross-referenced with state vessel registries and whether it could be used to facilitate inclusion of the registered owner’s name on the list."
WCPFC13,217,China was able to go along with PNG’s proposal to add master’s name and nationality to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 31 of 361
WCPFC13,218,USA associated itself with FFA members about the importance of addressing IUU fishing and asked for PNG to provide a proposal. PNG undertook to consult with USA in the margins and asked if the Secretariat cross-checked details from the vessel register with the Chinese Taipei vessel registry.
WCPFC13,219,"The Chair clarified for other CCMs that the TCC12 recommendation was to include the vessel master’s name in the list, and PNG’s new request was to include the vessel master’s nationality."
WCPFC13,220,"The Executive Director clarified that the Secretariat writes to the flag states of vessels that are on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, as tasked by TCC. The Secretariat receives information from the flag state but has not conducted direct checks with the Chinese Taipei vessel registry. The Secretariat relies on flag states to provide them with that information."
WCPFC13,221,"RMI thanked Chinese Taipei for its earlier update about the vessel, and encouraged the Commission’s further work on the issue. This CCM queried the effectiveness of the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, if vessels can recur at different times in different oceans without being caught. RMI suggested it would be useful for TCC to look at the issues and come up with options."
WCPFC13,222,"On 9 December, PNG provided proposed language for plenary discussions regarding the inclusion of nationality of the master of the vessel to further help identify the vessel. PNG explained that vessel names are often duplicative across multiple registries. After a request for clarification, PNG explained that vessel master’s nationality is already included in the RFV data fields. The Commission would only be agreeing to include on the final WCPFC IUU Vessel List the vessel master’s nationality alongside the vessel master’s name which had already been agreed."
WCPFC13,223,Kiribati supported the proposed language on the basis that it is masters that operate the vessels and conduct the IUU fishing activities.
WCPFC13,224,The Commission adopted the 2017 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment L).
WCPFC13,225,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat with including the names of the vessel masters, if available, into the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC13,226,The Commission tasked TCC with investigating options to address the circumstances of vessels remaining on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for many years.
WCPFC13,227,"The Commission agreed that: the master’s nationality is included alongside the master’s name into the WCPFC IUU Vessel List; and where the vessel is not listed on the Record of Fishing Vessels and the master’s name and nationality are not known, the flag State is responsible for providing the name and nationality of the master, so that these details can be included into the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. AGENDA ITEM 7 — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES"
WCPFC13,228,This is a standing agenda item for the Commission under Rule 2 (h) of the Rules of Procedures. 7.1 Updated checklist evaluation of SIDS’ special requirements
WCPFC13,229,"At WCPFC11, FFA members tabled a checklist that set out SIDS’ specific needs to assist in prioritising the assistance received from the Commission and other CCMs. WCPFC11 agreed to consider the checklist as a “guide to assist developed CCMs to assess the status of assistance to SIDS”. An updated checklist has since provided. In WCPFC13-2016-DP16, FFA members laid out some WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 32 of 361views on their approach to the checklist to make it an effective and efficient tool. The checklist will continue to set out SIDS’ needs, especially as arising out of the CMR discussions. It will be based on the capacity needs identified in the Final CMR and updated accordingly after WCPFC13. FFA members requested that these are treated as immediate areas for priority assistance from developed CCMs and noted that the checklist could track progress or delivery of assistance for these specific needs. 7.2 CCM reports on the implementation of Article 30"
WCPFC13,230,"WCPFC13 took as read the report on EU’s implementation of Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 2008-01 (WCPFC13-2016-DP27). The paper detailed assistance provided and proposed in future years. EU noted that capacity building assistance can also come from other kinds of assistance available in the region, not just through WCPFC. EU considered the checklist in CMM 2013-06 to be a valuable guide and noted that EU’s support was given to FFA to implement, so EU expected FFA would comply with the checklist when determining its priorities for the funding. EU commented that reporting from FFA on how it uses the assistance would be useful."
WCPFC13,231,FFA members thanked those CCMs that provided reports of their assistance or responded through their Annual Reports Part 2. It was noted that many of the reports did not provide sufficient information on targeted assistance under the categories in CMM 2013-07 or the SIDS Checklist. This made it difficult to properly review the implementation of the measure. FFA members requested that developed CCMs prioritise assistance to addressing specific areas identified for the SIDS Checklist to enable thorough analysis of the reports and linkages to the SIDS Checklist and implementation of CMM 2013-07.
WCPFC13,232,"Japan noted that it provided assistance in various forms for WCPFC assistance. Japan assists SIDS through its official development assistance, including Overseas Fisheries Cooperative Foundation (OFCF), enabling the construction of infrastructure and capacity building for artisanal fisheries, data collection and fisheries management. Since 2008 Japan has been assisting SIDS for capacity building in respect of statistics, and fisheries management and enforcement through the WCPFC Japan Trust Fund. Japan had pledged to provide no less than 55 billion Yen (around USD $5,000,000) in the next 3 years during the Seventh Pacific Leaders Meeting (PALM7) held in 2015. Japan also contributes to the Japan Promotion Fund agreement with the Forum Fisheries Agency. Japan sends fisheries experts to SIDS from JICA and OFCF and receives trainees from SIDS."
WCPFC13,233,"FFA members noted that several WCPFC13 proposals do not include a CMM 2013-06 SIDS’ impacts assessment or only cursorily attempted to complete the assessment. FFA members reminded proponents to fulfil this obligation, as it was a critical step to informing and reassuring SIDS that impacts on them have been taken into account when formulating proposals. CCMs should discuss proposals and their impacts with SIDS early. FFA members strong took the view that not conducting this assessment or not doing it in a timely or complete manner was a breach of CMM 2013-06. FFA members proposed that new proposals which do have no assessment or an incomplete assessment not provided in advance of the Commission meeting not be considered by the meeting and the proponent be considered non-compliant."
WCPFC13,234,Chinese Taipei noted that each year this issue is discussed but it was not clear how to establish criteria or a mechanism for CCMs to follow. Chinese Taipei proposed that the issue of the sustainability of the Special Requirements Fund (SRF) be discussed by FAC before consideration by WCPFC. This CCM noted the continuous demands on the fund and noted the Chinese Taipei Trust Fund to strengthen capacity building in WCPFC developing countries was USD$2 million beginning this year. Chinese Taipei encouraged SIDS to apply.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 33 of 361
WCPFC13,235,"FSM supported other FFA members’ statements and thanked developed states for their assistance. This CCM noted that Article 30 requires that capacity assistance be provided so SIDS can fully execute their obligations and participate in the work of the Commission. Part of the Commission’s work is to adopt CMMs, so when a proponent puts forward a measure which has implications for SIDS, if special assistance is required the proponents should outline how that assistance will be provided. FSM acknowledged resources including the SRF, the Japan Trust Fund and others, but emphasised that the issue at hand was the use of a checklist for proponents to outline the assistance they will provide so SIDS can implement their obligations and manage the resources. In the absence of that, FFA members would not be in a position to adopt the measure."
WCPFC13,236,"FFA members submitted WCPFC13-2016-DP17, a proposal to ensure the sustainability of the SRF, with a specific focus on participation at meetings. It was noted that the fund was near-exhausted for most of 2016. The dominant use of the fund has been to support SIDS’ travel to participate in WCPFC meetings. As the work of the Commission grows more complex and broad it is practically impossible for a single person to be across all issues, so meetings are meeting attended by at least two SIDS nationals per CCM. FFA members proposed that a compulsory amount be placed annually into the SRF. WCPFC13-2016-DP17 contains the specific financial formula. It was explained that the SRF would be drawn down as per current practice for an additional representative of a developing state member or for other needs such as internships or a national project. FFA members noted that meeting participation was the primary focus of the proposal, SIDS also need assistance to implement and comply with Commission measures."
WCPFC13,237,"Japan recognised the importance of assisting developing countries to participate in WCPFC meetings and supported a fund, but felt it should be voluntary not mandatory. Under its national system, Japan could not make mandatory contributions to the fund but it hoped other countries could do so. Another option would be to allocate from the regular budget to replenish the fund; FAC should explore the options."
WCPFC13,238,The Chair asked if CCMs agreed to the concept of making the voluntary fund mandatory.
WCPFC13,239,"Korea thanked those CCMs, including USA, which had made voluntary contributions to the fund, and recognised the need to replenish it. This CCM agreed that making it mandatory was an option, but it needed consideration. Noting the increase in the number of meetings which required in-person presence, this CCM suggested other ways, such as streamlining the number and efficiency of meetings."
WCPFC13,240,The Chair noted that a lack of consensus that the fund should become mandatory.
WCPFC13,241,China suggested that a percentage allocation from the regular budget could be an option.
WCPFC13,242,"Japan suggested looking first at voluntary contributions and if this is not possible the Commission could consider allocating money from the regular budget. The funding to be allocated would depend on the total budget, which was under discussion at FAC. Japan agreed that streamlining the number of meetings would help, noting that some meetings that have been held may not have been needed."
WCPFC13,243,"RMI noted that some of the proposals to WCPFC13 had not gone through the checklist, but stressed that this was not a stand-alone agenda item, it was about SIDS and their effective participation in Commission processes. This CCM noted that the balance of the SRF was USD $36,000, but the measures and obligations which require SIDS’ attention continue to increase. RMI emphasised that CMM 2013-06 and CMM 2013-07 were linked.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 34 of 361"
WCPFC13,244,"EU considered the checklist and the SRF were linked but separate. Internal EU rules precluded it from contributing to the SRF fund. But EU could support earmarking a certain percentage of the Commission budget for the SRF for attending meetings, similarly the case for IATTC. EU also noted that other sources of financing existed through other agencies in the region."
WCPFC13,245,Australia noted this was a core concern for SIDS and the FAC should consider these ideas. This CCM suggested that the ‘Travel’ line item in the core budget could be examined.
WCPFC13,246,The Chair noted that a number of options had been raised for consideration by FAC during WCPFC13. 7.3 Review of implementation of CMM 2013-07 (Paragraph 20)
WCPFC13,247,"In accordance with paragraph 20 of CMM 2013-07, the Commission reviews implementation progress of the Convention and CMM 2013-07 annually."
WCPFC13,248,"FFA Secretariat noted the valuable assistance CCMs provide and recognised that, taken together, it constitutes a huge body of support. Unless the questions in the CMM 2013-06 checklist are taken seriously, it is difficult for FFA members to discern if they have the capacity to take on an obligation. It was noted that CMM 2013-07 links to CMM 2013-06 and related to WCPFC measures and SIDS’ ability to participate in the work of the Commission. For example, one of the key priorities under the last EU-funded project in the Pacific was assisting countries to meet sanitary requirements to export to Europe – a very important project for SIDS but it did not enable SIDS to fill out the Annual Report Part 2 on time or conduct a minimum number of port inspections."
WCPFC13,249,"RMI expressed the view that the Commission is not in compliance with the Convention, with the responsibility for compliance resting on the Commission in the first instance then on each CCM. A number of proposals put to WCPFC13 did not address CMM 2013-06. This CCM suggested that proposed measures which have not been through a consultative process should not be on the agenda for discussion. The Commission and Secretariat should comply with the measure when reviewing proposals for the agenda. It was important for the Commission to understand that measures have impacts on SIDS, including in budgetary and technical capacity terms."
WCPFC13,250,FSM explained that the checklist identifies what might be required to assist SIDS. A process may be needed to allow for CCMs who are developing a proposal that funding could be attributed so it is clearly identified who is contributing and who is receiving assistance as a result of the measure.
WCPFC13,251,"EU sought clarification from FSM if this meant proponents would be expected to put up financial assistance in order to present a proposal, noting such a process does not exist in other RFMOs."
WCPFC13,252,"The Chair noted that this standing agenda item gives the Commission a chance to consider how measures affect its most vulnerable members. The Chair commented that SIDS’ issues flow throughout the whole meeting agenda and this item was an opportunity to discuss if proponents providing evaluations against CMM 2013-06 are meeting expectations regarding SIDS. It was clear work was still required. The Chair encouraged CCMs to continue discussions through the week with SIDS’ and capacity-related issues in mind. In addition, the FAC would discuss the sustainability of the SRF and report back.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 35 of 361AGENDA ITEM 8 — HARVEST STRATEGY"
WCPFC13,253,"Discussions under this agenda item focused on those elements of the agreed Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 specifically earmarked for decision in 2016 (see: WCPFC12 Summary Report, Attachment Y and WCPFC13-2016-IP02). 8.1 Management objectives (all species)"
WCPFC13,254,"The Work Plan requires the Commission to record the management objectives for the four species it covers. The Chair distributed draft management objectives in Circular No. 2016/34, which originate from Management Objectives Workshops (MOW) outcomes and were accepted by WCPFC11 (WCPFC13-2016-11b). These were circulated in July to give CCMs time to reconsider the draft management objectives as a starting point for discussions. The Chair noted that the USA had also proposed management objectives for one of the three fisheries that were discussed in the context of the MOWs."
WCPFC13,255,"USA explained that it had developed its proposal WCPFC13-2016-DP22 due to its reluctance to adopt a long list of candidate management objectives. USA agreed strongly with one aspect of the ‘strawman’ document and the Chair’s proposal: that the management objectives, and the harvest strategies as a whole, should be structured around fisheries not stocks. The USA proposal was limited to the tropical purse-seine fishery. It could serve as an example; if a set of objectives such as that contained in the proposal were acceptable, similar sets could be developed for the tropical longline fishery and the southern albacore fishery. Another important aspect of the ‘strawman’ document is its documenting of the connections among the fisheries, including competition and upstream-downstream links, and that aspect is incorporated in the USA proposal."
WCPFC13,256,The Chair noted that the question for discussion was whether or not the Commission supported the U.S. approach relating to the tropical purse-seine fishery or the MOW approach as contained in Circular No. 2016/34.
WCPFC13,257,"FFA members supported the Chair’s approach in Circular 2016/34 based on the MOWs. While the objectives do not exactly mirror the objectives of FFA members, they came from a process that involved independent experts and included all CCMs over a period of two or more years. They were a reasonable compromise and provided greater clarity than having no management objectives at all. FFA members considered the objectives be simply “recorded” rather than agreed, and that they be used to guide the development of further elements of the harvest strategy. The objectives would not be considered prescriptive and there is no expectation that every objective would be monitored and reported against as the Commission develops harvest strategies. FFA members did not support USA’s approach."
WCPFC13,258," Japan noted that harvest strategies are comprised of several elements, with management objectives just one of the parts. Until all the components were assembled, Japan could not agree any of the components without knowing the consequences, so its position on them would remain tentative until the finalisation of the whole. Japan raised a number of issues: the Harvest Strategy Work Plan required management objectives for skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tuna, so Japan felt that it was more natural to look at each species rather than each fishery catching those species. For this reason the concept behind the U.S. paper was more difficult to understand. Japan asked for clarification around what it meant for the Commission to “record” management objectives. The Commission could add many management objectives, but some may be in contradiction to others, with a reconciliation process then needed. This CCM considered the discussion to be valuable but clarity around the future prospects of the work was needed, especially what happens after making the list. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 36 of 361"
WCPFC13,259,"EU noted there were merits to both approaches: USA’s was in line with the Convention language, notably as it refers to MSY; the Chair’s approach reflected discussions WCPFC13 had engaged in previously. EU had favoured continuing the MOW work and considered further work was needed on the approach in the Circular to refine the objectives as, like Japan had raised, there could be difficulties reconciling them. EU thought further discussions about what the Commission was trying to achieve was needed before recording or noting any management objectives."
WCPFC13,260,"Australia supported the Chair’s approach to recording management objectives, commenting that a key aspect was not the objectives themselves but how they are used to progress the harvest strategy approach. Australia noted that the Work Plan explicitly tasked the Commission to ‘record’ rather than ‘agree’ the management objectives, and commented that some of the objectives will conflict and some will require trade-offs. The objectives provide guidance for the Scientific Services Provider to develop the MSE framework and performance indicators. The MSE will allow the Commission to assess the performance of candidate harvest control rules and to objectively consider the trade-offs, which is similar to the approach taken in NC."
WCPFC13,261,"PNG supported the Chair’s approach and the precautionary approach to improving decision making, and did not favour starting from scratch."
WCPFC13,262,"Chinese Taipei suggested that the Commission needed more time to discuss priorities and management objectives, noting too many objectives were outlined in the Circular, with possible conflicts. This CCM hoped that the management objectives would generally follow the Convention text."
WCPFC13,263,"China considered that harvest strategies were a means of achieving the objectives of the Convention, which was the sustainable utilisation of tuna resources, so the reference points should be based on MSY. This CCM considered that discussing harvest strategies was premature until a common understanding was reached on this. China understood that all the reference points are linked with TAC –once MSY is established three reference points are used to reduce the level of TAC. China pointed out that we do not know the relationship between reference points with the VDS. It was noted that the VDS was an input control tool and reference points linked with TAC which is an output control tool. China was concerned that the reference point will only be applied to high seas fisheries, not those in areas of national jurisdiction. Two years ago the Commission adopted a TRP for skipjack tuna, but China noted that this TRP has not yet translated into management action. China wished to see the final product of the TRP in the bridging tropical tuna CMM, noting that fishermen need to know how much fish they can catch. Until then, China was unable to consider TRPs for other tuna species."
WCPFC13,264,"Japan acknowledged the time CCMs had spent on the MOW discussions, but noted that the workshops were to help CCMs learn about harvest strategies and the MSE process, and encourage frank discussions about them; the outcomes were not binding and the management objectives in the document did not represent the agreement of the working group. This CCM favoured developing a list of two or three management objectives, adding that they were used to evaluate different harvest strategies so should not be overly complicated. Japan suggested looking at the issue by species, with sustainability of the stock the guiding principle. Japan noted that both papers looked at certain types of fisheries, and queried what would happen to fisheries not covered, for example the skipjack fishery."
WCPFC13,265,"Canada supported continuing the discussions in a small working group. This CCM considered the management objectives outlined were an indicative and useful list, but agreed with Japan that it should not be considered an agreed, select list; there should be further refinement specific to the development of individual harvest strategies. Canada noted NC’s approach, which held technical meetings including WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 37 of 361scientists, managers and industry. This CCM underscored importance of the objectives being quantifiable."
WCPFC13,266,"RMI commented that further work was needed to refine the objectives, and noted the information provided by SPC in WCPFC13-2016-14. RMI supported recording management objectives as the Chair had circulated."
WCPFC13,267,"PNA members were pleased to see this work being undertaken at WCPFC13. These CCMs supported the work on harvest strategies and the application of the precautionary approach as a way of improving decision-making on management and conservation of key stocks and saw the potential benefits of having pre-agreed rules for how fishing will be adjusted as status of stocks change, and better taking account of uncertainty. These CCMs commented that harvest strategies were not a way of reshaping arrangements and approaches already agreed, except where necessary to ensure sustainability. On this basis, PNA would continue to strongly support harvest strategy outcomes that strengthen and do not undermine the rights of resource-owning CCMs to manage resources and fisheries in their waters compatibly with measures applied in other areas within the Convention area."
WCPFC13,268,"The Pew Charitable Trusts made a statement on behalf of PEW, WWF, Greenpeace, Conservation International, and SFP, noting these NGOs were pleased to witness WCPFC’s commitment to the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. It was noted that the aim for WCPFC13 is to ‘record’ some management objectives, not adopt them – they are not unchangeable. Harvest strategies are a package of elements, as noted by Japan, that are then ideally tested by MSE and modified if needed based on those analyses. These NGOs noted that it would be regrettable and a step backward if the Commission could not record a list of management objectives for consideration. It was noted that PEW and ISSF have produced explanatory materials as a contribution to this process, including case studies of harvest strategies in practice."
WCPFC13,269,"The Chair noted that the Commission had committed to developing harvest strategies going forward. The term ‘record’ stresses that the immediate goal was not a binding agreement, and followed the logic that everything is interim until everything is final. The purpose of circulating the ‘strawman’ document was to remind CCMs that they had already done a lot of work, discussions had been held with stakeholders and the Commission had received and accepted a report which discussed management objectives. The Chair appreciated the desire of some CCMs not to reinvent the wheel. It was also noted that this was the first year the Commission had taken a comprehensive look at the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. Though the MOW process had been discontinued, the compromise was to ensure management-level discussions took place at the Commission. The goal was not to find agreement but to find a basis for future work, perhaps an acknowledgement that these objectives could be used for the harvest strategies work. The Chair noted that WCPFC13-2016-14 reflects the other elements of the ‘strawman’ proposal – the indicators and the monitoring strategies. It may be that general acceptance of those indicators could point towards some implicit acceptance of the objectives they were developed against."
WCPFC13,270,"USA noted that two possible options were to start with a long list of possible management objectives and trim it, or start with a small list and expand it. Either way, the likelihood would be that with further discussions, the end point would be different to the start point."
WCPFC13,271,"Japan (Shuya Nakatsuka) offered to lead the small working group and, on 7 December, reported on its progress. Using the list within Circular No. 2016/34 and USA’s proposal, the group had tried to come up with a list of interim management objectives to be used solely for the purpose of MSE and the application of harvest control rules. They could be modified in the future. Japan noted that not all were agreed but the group was making progress. On 8 December, Japan reported that the group had WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 38 of 361finished discussions on a list of indicators for evaluating harvest control rules for tropical purse-seine fisheries though several significant issues had emerged."
WCPFC13,272,"On 9 December, Japan advised that the informal small working group had developed a list of useful indicators, without agreeing or disagreeing to them, noting that different management objectives had different levels of importance to different CCMs. A question was whether the work should be conducted for primarily skipjack tuna (though the group also touched on bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna) MSE only or for multiple species MSE."
WCPFC13,273,"The Chair noted that this work was in the context of the harvest strategies framework which was set out by species, not by fisheries. The Chair noted the cross linkages and emphasised that the Commission was not attempting to agree to a set of objectives at this stage but would note the work done by the informal small working group and the direction its output provided, primarily for skipjack tuna."
WCPFC13,274,"Australia noted that, for 2016, the Harvest Strategy Work Plan requires the Commission to record management objectives for all four species – skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye tuna and South Pacific albacore. Australia was pleased that the Commission had engaged in discussions around the management objectives and hoped these discussions continued at future Commission meetings. For 2016, the Commission was also scheduled to agree a monitoring strategy, including performance indicators, for skipjack tuna and South Pacific albacore. Australia acknowledged the good progress made on skipjack tuna and thanked the Chair of the informal small working group for his leadership. Australia proposed that the Commission task SPC with developing a relevant set of performance indicators for South Pacific albacore, proposing that SPC make reference to interim performance indicators for skipjack and South Pacific albacore tuna. This will allow the research provider to progress the development of harvest strategy-related work but also allow for further consideration and refinement by SC and WCPFC as necessary."
WCPFC13,275,"EU considered that the outcome fell short of the task WCPFC13 had for this meeting. WCPFC13 was supposed to have progressed further, across more species, and adopt management objectives. EU supported Australia’s comments, recognising that Australia had been the lead on the Harvest Strategy Work Plan’s development."
WCPFC13,276,"Japan noted that while also not necessarily satisfied with outcome, the exercise indicated how difficult it will be to agree management objectives. In the meantime, participants had learned about the process and come to understand that the Commission should not be so optimistic about formulating harvest strategies. The current management objectives mainly consider skipjack tuna caught in the tropical purse-seine fisheries and, from the outset, a consequential question was whether to look at species/stock, rather than fisheries. However, this CCM noted that positive and negative impacts of tropical purse-seine skipjack tuna fishing on other fisheries catching the same species and other stocks affected by those fisheries also needed to be taken into account. Japan welcomed the management objectives discussions, however if the outcome did not address the impacts of the fishery on other stocks Japan could not support it. Until there was a final product, Japan considered everything tentative."
WCPFC13,277,"Shuya Nakatsuka, in his capacity as Chair of the informal small working group, noted that for some of the indicators for other fisheries, SPC can provide information. But from a scientific point of view, he considered it premature to attempt fully fledged multi-species MSE and suggested asking SPC to conduct MSE based on the indicators, with as much information as possible for other fisheries, then consider how to approach multi-species MSE, which, it was noted, had been done nowhere else in the world. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 39 of 361"
WCPFC13,278,The Chair expressed optimism about the output which had been developed by the informal small working group – it had shown just how complex harvest strategies were. The Commission had understood in 2015 that its goals for the work were highly ambitious and aspirational. What the group had accomplished was realistic and reasonable considering how early in the process the Commission was in implementing harvest strategies. The Chair expressed the view that the Commission could task SPC to work on the management objectives which had been developed by the informal small working group.
WCPFC13,279,Korea commented that member cooperation in the informal small working group had resulted in some meaningful outcomes and noted its preference for a stock-based approach. From next year Korea wanted to work on management objectives and other relevant indicators for longline.
WCPFC13,280,"Fiji supported Australia’s comments, commenting that what was applied for skipjack tuna should also be applied for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,281,"PNA members supported the group’s approach as set out in its report. The indicators provide a good basis for work towards MSE on skipjack and the purse-seine fishery, and for the development of indicators for other stocks and fisheries, especially albacore and the southern longline fishery. PNA members supported Australia’s proposal for further work on management objectives and performance indicators for south Pacific albacore and would work with SPC to progress this."
WCPFC13,282,Tonga supported Fiji and PNG’s interventions.
WCPFC13,283,"USA considered the outcomes to be a step forward, and noted that there were options about how to structure harvest strategies. USA wanted to approach the work from a fisheries perspective, not stocks, recalling that the harvest strategies framework intentionally leaves open both of those approaches. USA clarified that the outcomes of the working group were not for skipjack tuna, they were for the tropical purse-seine fishery. However, in USA’s view each identified indicator was very clear so it did not matter what it was called. USA supported accepting the outcomes from the working group. This CCM noted that some indicators were straightforward and could be monitored at no additional cost; others could bring substantial costs, so there was a need to proceed cautiously. Acceptance of the identified indicators did not necessarily mean the Commission adopts or commits to implement the strategies necessary to monitor the indicators. Such decisions would be made on a project-by-project basis, informed by SC advice and the expected costs of monitoring."
WCPFC13,284,"A short discussion took place about Australia’s proposal for SPC to work on similar indicators for South Pacific albacore. Tonga and New Zealand supported Australia’s comment, noting it was already scheduled in the Work Plan and highlighting the importance of South Pacific albacore for SIDS. China considered tasking SPC to do this work was premature. Australia clarified that it was suggesting work already required for 2016 under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. While not set in stone, Australia felt SPC should go forward and do some of the work. China suggested further discussion among CCMs. Noting the ongoing work required to develop the specific objectives and indicators for south Pacific albacore, members acknowledged the benefit of SPC adapting the list of indicators developed for tropical purse seine fisheries to further similar work for south Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,285,"The Chair characterised the work as preliminary and aligned it with the work being undertaken on the bridging tropical tuna measure, adding that to the extent possible the Commission should try to follow the Work Plan. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 40 of 361"
WCPFC13,286,The Commission accepted the suggested initial list of performance indicators for tropical purse-seine fisheries as developed by the Small Working Group on Management Objectives at WCPFC13 for the purpose of the evaluation of harvest control rules (This list is attached at Attachment M). 8.2 Acceptable levels of risk (all species)
WCPFC13,287,"The Commission is required to agree acceptable levels of risk for the four species covered by the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. Discussions on this began in plenary session, with brief introductions of the two proposals – FFA’s, which used interim risk levels of 5% for skipjack and South Pacific albacore with 10% for yellowfin tuna; and USA’s which used a risk level of 20% for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,288,"FFA members introduced their proposal WCPFC13-2016-DP10 and expressed that they have advocated an interim risk level of 5% for skipjack and South Pacific albacore for some time, and 10% for yellowfin, considering risk levels to be consistent with the requirement to adopt risk levels that are very low, and that the social, economic and biological consequences of the risk levels are acceptable. These CCMs noted that the additional level of precaution captured in the risk levels for albacore and skipjack, reflects the relative importance and severity of the consequences of low levels of those two stocks. FFA members considered it premature to adopt a risk level for bigeye tuna as the first priority for this stock is to allow it to recover to the LRP. When that recovery is underway, the Commission can identify a suitable level of risk as a buffer above the LRP, and eventually implement a TRP. FFA members did not support the USA proposal of risk levels of 20% for all four key tuna species, disagreeing with the rationale for these higher levels of risk. The LRPs are biologically “precautionary” as required by the Convention, and FFA members did not consider them overly conservative. The Commission should take care not to introduce acceptable risk levels that erode the capacity of the LRP to provide strong protection. FFA members had issues with USA’s use of the interim IATTC limit reference point for skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna of 7% as evidence that the 20% WCPFC limits are overly conservative. These CCMs recognised that both proposals acknowledged that risk is not only about probability but also about biological, social and economic consequences. Economic and social impacts increase as biomass declines towards the limit and the ability to recover quickly is reduced once recruitment is affected, with costs associated with lengthy recovery periods, particularly for those communities that rely on fisheries most."
WCPFC13,289,"USA introduced its proposal WCPFC13-2016-DP23, a proposal for interim risk levels of 20% for all four stocks under CMM 2014-06. USA explained that the proposal is based in large part on the outcomes of SC12, which recommended “that WCPFC13 notes that levels of risk for breaching LRP should be considered coupled with the corresponding conservative or liberal nature of the LRP”.  The SC concluded that “the bigeye tuna LRP is viewed as conservative and could have associated higher levels of risk for breaching the LRP”.  The proposal is not based on the IATTC’s adopted interim risk levels. USA did not propose changing the limits WCPFC has adopted. FFA members’ proposed levels of risk are different for different stocks because of the relative importance FFA members place on the stocks – based on the social and economic consequences of breaching the limits. USA considered that the risk levels, which are tied to the limit reference points, should be based solely on biological considerations, drawing from the Convention and Annex 2 of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which states that LRPs are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits and TRPs are intended to meet management objectives. Unlike the USA proposal, the FFA members’ proposal does not include an acceptable level of risk for bigeye tuna, which could help inform what a reasonable rebuilding timeline would be for the stock."
WCPFC13,290,"An informal small working group was formed to discuss the proposals, led by Vice-Chair Russell Smith. On 7 December, the Vice Chair reported that participants had discussed their objectives and WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 41 of 361concerns about breaching the LRP for South Pacific albacore, skipjack and yellowfin tuna. With this input, SPC has a better understanding of what participants are trying to achieve. There was agreement on how to move forward on these three stocks but not for bigeye tuna and the group would return to the question today. The informal small working group also talked about the interim nature of the numbers and the iterative process towards full harvest control rules for these stocks."
WCPFC13,291,"On 8 December, the Vice Chair recalled that the task of the group was to consider for the four stocks the risk levels that would be applied in evaluating various harvest control rules and other instruments regarding whether there would be a breach of the LRP. There were robust discussions in the group and a text was largely agreed except for one set of issues requiring further discussion. The text provided that in reviewing the expected performance of harvest control rules or CMMs for these four stocks the Commission would consider any outcome that had a risk level of more than 20% of breaching the LRP as being inconsistent with the Convention. The text also addressed how to deal with stocks currently below the LRP. For those stocks there was an attempt to clarify that the Commission would look to specific rebuilding strategies to include a schedule and probabilities. There was some discussion in the informal small working group about how this decision would apply to CMMs."
WCPFC13,292,"On 9 December the Vice-Chair reported that a text had been developed to help guide work as the Commission continues developing harvest strategies and applying MSE. The Chair noted that the discussions were conducted in the context of the further evaluations SPC would be doing. In thinking about how the results would be found by those looking to utilise them, the Vice-Chair suggested an Annex to the Harvest Strategy Work Plan would make them more accessible and allow the Secretariat to more easily capture them and put them on the dedicated section of the website."
WCPFC13,293,"Following these discussions on acceptable risk levels of breaching a LRP, EU shared its views about the LRP adopted by WCPFC for skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin tuna and South Pacific albacore in the broader context of the harvest strategies framework. CMM 2014-06 (Annex 1) defines LRPs as references “intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits”. EU’s interpretation of this is that LRPs should be founded purely on biological considerations, and should therefore be defined on a stock by stock basis. In addition, LRPs have to be associated with level of risks commensurate with the degree of precaution considered when defining the level or value of the LRPs. Based on the most recent information available, EU noted that for some of the stocks, the SSB depletion level corresponding to MSY are just above or even below the general LRP of 20% SSBf=0 adopted by the Commission. EU was uncomfortable with the idea that one of the principles of the Convention “to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield” would be framed as “outside safe biological limits” for these species. EU proposed the Commission request SC13 to review the adopted LRP and proposed: i) stock specific LRPs that “constrain harvesting within safe biological limits”, updating accordingly CMM 2014-06, and ii) acceptable risk levels of breaching these LRPs that take into account their liberal or conservative nature."
WCPFC13,294,"Australia did not support EU’s proposal, considering this review work to have been done from Australia’s point of view, the WCPFC limit reference points are not overly conservative. The LRPs are biologically “precautionary” and therefore in line with the requirements of the Convention. The LRPs recognise the uncertainty associated with “steepness” (how much recruitment will occur at low stock sizes) and other aspects of tuna biology. This uncertainty makes quantities such as MSY extremely difficult to estimate without fishing the stock well below the point. This issue was explored extensively by SC7 in 2011 and ultimately resulted in the Commission adopting the current B20% limits which are precautionary with respect to the uncertainty. Australia noted that the Commission accepted the LRP to protect the biological productivity of the stocks, recognising uncertainty. The Commission should take care not to erode the capacity of the LRP to provide that protection. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 42 of 361"
WCPFC13,295,EU presented text late in the meeting for the Commission’s consideration but it was not agreed. New Zealand noted that a large body of work now existed and they were consistent with approaches taken by other national and international jurisdictions.
WCPFC13,296,"After discussion of the proposals of the FFA members and the USA, and based on the recommendation of the working group, the Commission agreed to: i) not specify, at this time, acceptable levels of risk of breaching the limit reference point for each stock; ii) consider any risk level greater than 20 percent to be inconsistent with the LRP related principle in UNFSA (as referenced in Article 6 of the Convention) including that the risk of breaching limit reference points be very low; and iii) determine the acceptability of potential HCRs where the estimated risk of breaching the limit reference point is between 0 and 20%. 8.3 Rebuilding timelines for bigeye tuna"
WCPFC13,297,"The Commission is required under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan to agree timelines to rebuild the bigeye stock to the LRP. Discussions began in plenary session and were continued in an informal small working group led by Australia. On 7 December, Australia noted that there had been useful discussions and strong engagement in the group about the time period for recovering bigeye tuna to the LRP. The participants agreed that progress was being made. It was clear that a number of timeframes were available to get to the LRP and many participants considered it achievable. The group looked at different timeframes and impacts on fishing activity, and also considered what the timeframes meant when built into overall harvest strategies; all are interim measures while the models are run. It was noted that bigeye does recover in reasonable periods of a time, though there may be a range of years rather than a fixed point in time."
WCPFC13,298,"On 8 December, Australia reported that the group had canvassed options around the timeframe for bigeye tuna rebuilding. Issues included the risk of achieving the LRP, the measures required to get there and impacts, although participants recognised that impacts were a matter for the bridging tropical tuna measure. There was a general view that the Commission could agree a 10-year timeframe to reach the LRP, then provide that timeframe to SPC to run the models and scenarios. Those model runs may throw up some alternative ways of getting there. Draft language would be circulated reflecting these discussions."
WCPFC13,299,"On 9 December, the draft text was discussed in plenary. Australia reported that the group’s recommendation was that an interim rebuilding period of 10 years could be applied in the development of measures (such as the tropical tuna measure) to rebuild bigeye tuna to the LRP.  This rebuilding period would be referred to by science services provider in modelling the likely outcomes of rebuilding measures."
WCPFC13,300,"China thanked Australia for its hard work in leading the group. Before the 10-year rebuilding period was agreed, China wanted to know the implications, including by what percentage fishing had to be cut down. China did not object to the timeframe but hoped it was not compulsory."
WCPFC13,301,"Japan also stressed the interim nature of the 10 year timeframe. If the Commission sets parameters that are too harsh, it could reduce the timeline or reduce the probability.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 43 of 361"
WCPFC13,302,"Australia explained that there were a number of scenarios and 10 years would be the target provided to SPC as an interim timeline. SPC would do the analysis to show how that could be achieved then report back to the Commission. 10 years was not a target, it was a number for SPC to use."
WCPFC13,303,The Chair emphasised that the timeframes were interim and were to inform ongoing processes.
WCPFC13,304,"In accordance with the Work Plan for the adoption of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-05, the Commission is scheduled to agree a timeframe for rebuilding bigeye tuna to [or above] its LRP."
WCPFC13,305,The Commission agreed to an interim timeframe of up to ten years for rebuilding the bigeye tuna stock to the agreed Limit Reference Point of 0.2SBF=0.
WCPFC13,306,"The Commission shall use this timeframe in its development and evaluation of strategies and conservation and management measures relevant to the rebuilding of bigeye tuna. Amongst other matters, the Commission will consider the probability of the bigeye stock being at or above the limit reference point at the end of the rebuilding timeframe. 8.4 Target reference point (South Pacific albacore)"
WCPFC13,307,"The Commission is required under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan to consider a TRP for South Pacific albacore. FFA presented WCPFC13-2016-DP09, noting it was not a new proposal. The text in WCPFC13-2016-DP09 emerged from a working group at WCPFC12 after consultations. It had not been possible to finalise the South Pacific albacore TRP proposal at that meeting, but FFA members hoped to gain agreement at WCPFC13. These CCMs noted why FFA felt it could be adopted as an interim TRP this year: the Commission has already set a precedent for agreement of an interim TRP that has bioeconomic dimensions in the skipjack TRP last year; FFA has engaged in further consultations with interested CCMs, and there is a better understanding of each others’ goals and constraints, and how all can benefit from a TRP that would allow different harvest control rule scenarios to be tested for the South Pacific albacore stock, including the potential for acquiring or maintaining MSC certification; and the agreed Harvest Strategy Work Plan timeframe for agreeing this TRP is one year overdue and no other proposals have been tabled. FFA expressed that they hoped to move forward with a cooperative mechanism to manage catches of South Pacific albacore within their EEZs, but recognised it was difficult without an effective limit on the high seas component of the fishery. The interim TRP would provide the foundation parties can work within. FFA members do not have the capacity to use all the South Pacific albacore fishing opportunities within their EEZs and many will continue to rely on partnerships with distant water fishing fleets. Improving the profitability of individual vessels can only be achieved by maintaining catch rates. These CCMs noted that a TRP is essential for the development of a harvest strategy and looked forward to identifying a mutually acceptable one. Discussions began in plenary session and were continued in an informal small working group led by Samoa.  Late on 9 December, a draft text was discussed in plenary."
WCPFC13,308,An informal small working group led by Samoa met on 6 and 8 December to discuss the proposal in WCPFC13-2016-DP09 for a Conservation and Management Measure to define an interim Target Reference Point for the South Pacific Albacore stock.
WCPFC13,309,"The SWG noted from the report of SC12 that the stock was not overfished relative to the 20% SB/SBF=0 LRP and that overfishing was not occurring relative to F/FMSY, but that stock is not in equilibrium. Biomass and CPUE continues to decline and that if current levels of longline effort continue there is a 19% probability of the stock breaching its Limit Reference Point within 20 years. The SWG noted the SC12 Management Advice that “longline fishing mortality and longline catch be WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 44 of 361reduced to avoid further decline in the vulnerable biomass so that economically viable catch rates can be maintained.”"
WCPFC13,310,"The SWG considered the implications of different options for restoring the stock to the proposed Target Reference Point over a period of up to 20 years, ranging from a large immediate cut in effort to a series of small cuts, informed by a bioeconomic projection analysis presented by SPC and FFA."
WCPFC13,311,"A majority of CCMs in the informal small working group indicated their interest in negotiating an interim TRP for the stock against the starting point proposed by FFA members of 45%SB/SBF=0, but China was not yet in a position to enter such a negotiation until the implications of different TRP levels were better understood in terms of the catch or effort changes that would be required to restore and maintain the stock at the TRP and noting that China is still observing how the skipjack TRP is functioning."
WCPFC13,312,The SWG was thus unable to recommend that WCPFC13 adopt the interim TRP proposal in WCPFC13-2016-DP09. The following three decisions were agreed to be included in the WCPFC13 record:
WCPFC13,313,"WCPFC13 requested that existing analyses of the implications of different TRP levels – in terms of total catch and effort changes required – should be re-circulated to CCMs by FFA before the end of December 2016, and that the Scientific Services Provider assist CCMs in understanding the economic implications of different TRPs for their vessels before SC13."
WCPFC13,314,"WCPFC13 agreed to defer the possible adoption of an interim Target Reference Point for the South Pacific Albacore stock, which had originally been agreed to take place in 2015 under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan, until December 2017 at the latest."
WCPFC13,315,"The Commission directed that further discussion of the TRP should take place over the course of 2017 as part of the ongoing consultative process for the development of a Bridging Measure for the Conservation and Management of the South Pacific Albacore stock, and should include a report on progress by the Convenor of that process to the 13th WCPFC Scientific Committee."
WCPFC13,316,"FFA members noted that the interim Target Reference Point for this stock agreed by the Participants to the Tokelau Arrangement remains in effect, and that this interim TRP would continue to guide their management measures and actions in areas under their national jurisdiction until superseded by a substantive TRP. Tokelau Arrangement Participants or the Parties to the South Pacific Albacore Catch Management Agreement will provide annually to the Commission the Total Allowable Catch of south Pacific albacore in waters under their national jurisdiction guided by this interim TRP. They drew the attention of other CCMs to the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention, particularly paragraphs 2b.i, 2c and 2d."
WCPFC13,317,"Australia noted with disappointment that despite the willingness of most CCMs, the Commission was unable to reach agreement on a TRP for South Pacific albacore. Australia strongly encouraged any CCM that does not recognise the urgency for the development of a TRP and ultimately a harvest strategy for this stock, or does not fully understand the benefits of these, to consult the substantial existing work on this matter and engage with the Scientific Services provider to clarify any issues, refer to the wide range of harvest strategies that have been implemented across the world, including by CCSBT and CCAMLR, engage constructively in discussions with CCMs on this matter over the next 12 months, and come to WCPFC14 with a fresh outlook and a willingness to contribute to a WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 45 of 361decision on the TRP level that will be of benefit to all countries interested in maintaining South Pacific albacore as a sustainable fishery that continues to provide economic benefits. 8.5 Harvest control rules (South Pacific albacore and skipjack)"
WCPFC13,318,"The Chair noted that the key outcome was that the Commission was moving forward with harvest control rules, on the understanding that SPC will do further work and report back to WCPFC14."
WCPFC13,319,"Japan noted that the management strategies work would be interim until a whole package is available. Japan supported SPC doing the work, though expressed some concerns about the budget."
WCPFC13,320,"EU acknowledged the budget was a challenge and announced that EU would provide €100,000 to underpin the work advancing harvest strategies in the Commission. EU was thanked for this contribution. 8.6 Management strategy evaluation (South Pacific albacore and skipjack)"
WCPFC13,321,There was no discussion under this agenda item.  8.7 Monitoring Strategy (South Pacific albacore and skipjack)
WCPFC13,322,There was no discussion under this agenda item. 8.8 Review of Work Plan
WCPFC13,323,"The Chair emphasised that while a number of aspects of the Harvest Strategy Work Plan are aspirational, it was incumbent on the Commission to keep the harvest strategy elements going forward. It was noted that 2016 was the first year the Commission had focused on work under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan, and the Commission may not be able to progress everything it hoped to each year. At the request of the Chair, Australia led work in the margins to review the Harvest Strategy Work Plan, which is required of the Commission annually. After meetings in the margins, an updated Work Plan was presented to the Commission for adoption which incorporated consultation discussions and took into account SPC’s capacity to do the work."
WCPFC13,324,"China advised that it could support the revised Work Plan, noting it was a “strawman” which could be changed, especially as regards South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,325,"PNG expressed some concern about one of the decision points by 2019, noting it referred to specific work PNA was progressing. PNG wanted to review how it fit with PNA’s planned work. This point was removed from the updated plan."
WCPFC13,326,"The Commission adopted the Updated Harvest Strategy Work Plan (Attachment N). The Secretariat was tasked with documenting progress achieved under the Harvest Strategies agenda item in the form of an annex to the Harvest Strategy Work Plan to serve as a reference document to track progress against the agreed work plan.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 46 of 361AGENDA ITEM 9 — WCPO TUNA STOCKS  9.1  General overview of stock status (bigeye, Pacific bluefin tuna, skipjack, North Pacific albacore, South Pacific albacore and yellowfin)"
WCPFC13,327,"Dr John Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented a summary of the status of tropical tuna fisheries and stocks, noting that the presentation summarises fishery information provided in WCPFC-SC12-2016/GN-WP-01 and stock status information contained in the various assessment reports presented to SC in recent years. Total estimated catches in 2015 were similar to the levels of 2012 and 2013, but was nearly 200,000 mt below the previous record catch in 2014 (2,882,511 mt). In the purse seine fishery, effort by the international large vessel fleet declined by about 20% in 2015 compared to 2014. This occurred because many vessels opted to not fish for parts of 2015 because of difficult economic conditions in the fishery. As a result the catch of skipjack, yellowfin and particularly bigeye tuna declined in 2015. CPUE has remained relatively stable at a high level since mid-2013, with some reductions during the FAD closures. VMS trip-length data indicate that high CPUE continued in 2016, including the first half of the FAD closure period. ENSO has a large effect on the purse seine fishery, with the El Nino conditions experienced in 2015 and early 2016 pushing the fishery to the east. The ENSO index has now moved back into the neutral range and is expected to remain so through at least mid-2017. In the tropical longline fishery, effort has increased over the past two decades, but has levelled off to some extent in the recent few years. There were reported declines in effort and catch in 2015, however these estimates may be under-reported and subject to later revision. Both yellowfin and bigeye CPUE in the fishery have declined over the long-term, but there has been a recent spike in the CPUE for both species. Effort and catch have also increased strongly in the southern longline fishery, but have levelled out in the most recent years. CPUE for albacore has declined over a long period of time. The stock status of the main tuna species was summarised as follows:   Skipjack – spawning biomass is close to the target reference point of 0.5 of the unfished level and fishing mortality is below the MSY level. The stock is therefore not overfished and is not experiencing overfishing.  Yellowfin – spawning biomass has been reduced to approximately 40% of the unfished level and fishing mortality is below the MSY level. The stock is therefore not overfished and is not experiencing overfishing. However the fishery is unlikely to be able to sustain any further increases in catch.  Bigeye – spawning biomass has been reduced to around 16% of the unfished level, less than the limit reference point of 20%, and fishing mortality remains above the MSY level. The stock is therefore in an overfished state and is experiencing overfishing.  South Pacific albacore – spawning biomass has been reduced to approximately 40% of the unfished level and fishing mortality is below the MSY level. The stock is therefore not overfished and is not experiencing overfishing. However the biomass available to the longline fishery has been depleted to the point where profitable fishing operations are threatened. Continued exploitation at current levels will further reduce the stock and result in approximately a 20% risk of breaching the limit reference point."
WCPFC13,328,"EU considered that a presentation about ‘key tuna stocks’ should include Pacific bluefin tuna, not just the tropical tuna stocks. Without Pacific bluefin tuna, the SPC presentation could perhaps be called ‘South Pacific albacore and tropical tunas’.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 47 of 361"
WCPFC13,329,"In response to a query from EU about the MSY level for different species, Dr John Hampton explained that MSY varies by species due to subtle dynamics of the different stocks, with the overall selectivity of the fishery (for example, longline fleets catch mostly larger adult fish) the most important factor. For skipjack tuna, the spawning biomass at MSY is around 25% of unfished levels, for yellowfin tuna around 30% of unfished levels, for bigeye tuna just over 20% of unfished levels and for albacore tuna around 15% of unfished levels. Where fishing takes place on the older part of the stock the level of spawning biomass depletion corresponding to MSY conditions tends to be lower, but where there is more balanced exploitation over the size structure, a higher stock size is required to support MSY."
WCPFC13,330,"Japan queried the stock assessment models used, noting that it was scientifically not possible to select a base case from various sensitivity runs because of the lack of likelihood profile and clear explanation for the selection of the value of over dispersion in tagging information in the reference case.  In response to SPC’s additional analysis provided in response to some CCMs’ concerns at SC12, including Japan’s concerns, this CCM stated that there remains concern about the over-weighting of tagging data and thus would like to continue to discuss with SPC."
WCPFC13,331,"Dr John Hampton responded that SPC had undertaken follow-up analyses of skipjack tuna after SC12 which addresses all of the queries which had been raised by some CCMs at SC12. In particular, SPC re-ran the models with a different spatial stratification which resulted in a slightly more optimistic picture than was presented at SC12. The models included more diagnostics and different hypotheses regarding natural mortality."
WCPFC13,332,"FFA members thanked SPC for the additional work to test the robustness of the 2016 skipjack stock assessment (WCPFC-SC12-SA-WP04a). These CCMs requested the following statement be placed in the WCPFC13 record: “FFA member CCMs commended the WCPFC Scientific Services provider for the world-class assessment of the skipjack stock that had been provided to the Commission in 2016. FFA members recognized that the relatively large amount of data, both operational data from fisheries and independent data from tagging and biological studies, had contributed to the quality of this assessment, but they also recognized the value of the primary modelling tool – MULTIFAN-CL – and its ability to provide a more spatially-explicit assessment than other models, allowing the assessment to be broken down into subregions. This spatially-explicit model, coupled with extensive tagging data, has given the Commission a much better appreciation of the connectivity and potential extent of interaction between the skipjack in different subregions than has been possible in other RFMOs.”"
WCPFC13,333,"In response to a request for clarification from Tonga regarding yellowfin tuna which, although not overfished, had a declining CPUE, Dr John Hampton noted that yellowfin tuna catches have been fairly stable for a long period of time, despite increasing effort. This indicates that it is not likely that fleets will be able to catch more yellowfin tuna than they currently do, which is in line with the SC12 recommendation that yellowfin tuna catches should not increase."
WCPFC13,334,"Japan noted the differing views on the stocks status of skipjack tuna at SC12, where Japan, China and Chinese Taipei did not agree to the results of the stock assessment provided by SPC, concerned that more data was needed for a more certain stock assessment result. Japan noted it was making efforts to collect more data."
WCPFC13,335,"Dr John Hampton noted that points of uncertainty existed with any stock assessment. For this reason, SPC scientists undertake a range of alternative model runs and try and characterise the uncertainty in the key results. While the range of models provides a range of outcomes in terms of spawning biomass depletion, the stock status conclusions remain consistent across the full range of the models explored. In particular, none of the models indicate that current levels of exploitation pose WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 48 of 361any significant risk of causing overfishing or of the stock approaching the limit reference point. SPC therefore has a high degree of confidence in the conclusions of the assessment."
WCPFC13,336,"PNA members supported FFA’s statement for the record and expressed their disappointment at any efforts to manipulate the outcomes of the scientific assessment of skipjack at SC12, which was particularly regrettable because it is related to the work on a harvest strategy for skipjack and it undermines the application of a harvest strategy approach and the precautionary approach to skipjack. PNA members could not accept this kind of approach with a stock of huge socio-economic importance to the people of the PNA states."
WCPFC13,337,"Japan recalled that SPC provided several scenarios and had explained that each scenario was equally plausible. In Japan’s view, if each scenario were equally plausible there should be a range of scenarios, rather than one chosen scenario. Japan agreed that there is always uncertainty, but hoped the quantum of uncertainty would be minimised in the future. Japan appreciated the additional assessment which was conducted and thanked SPC for its efforts. Japan’s main concern was the weight of the tagging data; Japan could not accept using the reference case provided by the base case. Japan agreed that the skipjack stock status was not of concern, so SC was able to reach consensus around the conservation advice, but emphasised that in its view there was no scientific case to choose one specific base case. Japan agreed to provide operational data to SPC to help measure stocks, while maintaining data confidentiality."
WCPFC13,338,"EU considered the skipjack tuna stock assessment undertaken by SPC to be robust and expressed surprise in the lack of confidence in the assessment result. Several models were run and all came to similar conclusions. EU commented that having ranges instead of picking one scenario has implications stocks beyond skipjack, and hoped Japan could go along with the 2016 skipjack stock assessment."
WCPFC13,339,"New Zealand supported the comments of EU and FFA members, considering the skipjack tuna stock assessment to be of a very high standard. This CCM recognised Japan’s comments about providing operational data and noted this would contribute positively to future stock assessments. 9.2  Review of CMM 2015-01 (bigeye, skipjack, yellowfin) 9.2.1 Review paragraphs 18, 25, 26, 28, 40, 43, and 61"
WCPFC13,340,"Paras. 18, 25, 26, 28, 43, and 61 contain those aspects of CMM 2015-01 that required the Commission’s consideration for the measure’s continued operation in 2017. The Secretariat prepared a reference paper (WCPFC13-2016-16_rev1)"
WCPFC13,341,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented a review of CMM 2015-01 for bigeye tuna (WCPFC13-2016-15). Both the performance of the fishery components (purse seine and longline) against the measure as written for 2015, and the potential for the CMM as written for 2017 to achieve its objective of removing bigeye overfishing. The evaluation indicated that purse-seine FAD set numbers and longline bigeye catch levels in 2014 were respectively ‘on track’ and ‘provisionally on track’, with the levels of effort and bigeye catch anticipated to arise under the CMM specifications for that year. A separate analysis examined whether full implementation of the CMM, under the conditions specified for 2017 would ultimately removing overfishing of bigeye tuna. The challenge was that it was not possible to define precisely what levels of purse-seine effort and longline catch would result in 2017, due to “either/or” choices within the CMM (e.g. purse-seining CCMs could choose between a three month FAD closure and overall FAD limit, or a four month FAD closure), exemptions and exclusions, and decisions yet to be made. Three different scenarios for 2017 conditions were therefore used to WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 49 of 361examine this implementation uncertainty, but Dr Graham Pilling noted that there is no certainty any of them will be correct. The scenarios were: ‘pessimistic’; ‘2016 choices’; and ‘optimistic’. Only under the ‘optimistic’ scenario were CMM objectives achieved by 2032, with F less than FMSY and no risk of the spawning biomass being below the LRP. Examining the trajectory of F/FMSY assuming the optimistic scenario conditions remained in place after 2017, CMM 2015-01 objectives would be achieved on average 7 years after the end of the measure, i.e. in 2024. As WCPFC stock assessments generally report fishing mortality conditions three years in the past, this would imply that only in 2027 would stock assessments identify whether the CMM had been successful. However, Dr Graham Pilling noted that earlier stock assessments should identify if the trajectory of F/FMSY and risk of SB < LRP are ‘on track’ to achieve objectives"
WCPFC13,342,"The Chair noted the importance of this information as WCPFC13 considers the bridging measure, to inform discussions in the informal small working group, especially regarding the rebuilding timelines for bigeye tuna."
WCPFC13,343,"Japan noted that whereas when the current measure was agreed it was expected that FMSY for bigeye tuna would be reached by 2017, under the optimistic scenario it would take seven years to get to FMSY, and asked whether this was correct. Secondly, Japan commented that the optimistic scenario indicated a chance to revert from F to FMSY only, but asked how realistic this was. Regarding recruitment, the assumption was that recent good recruitment would continue to 2032, but Japan believed this was too optimistic. Fourthly, Japan commented that converting F to FMSY would probably not be possible because there were too many exemptions, for example some CCMs had greatly reduced their longline bigeye catch but at the same time bigeye catch increased because of increasing the number of longline vessels without limitation. Without exemptions, a brighter picture could be assumed than currently."
WCPFC13,344,"Regarding the timeframes for rebuilding or reducing fishing mortality, Dr Graham Pilling observed that as SPC had noted in the paper, the language in paragraph 3 of the CMM was open to interpretation, but the discussions taking place at WCPFC13 about bigeye tuna rebuilding timeframes would help to clarify it. On whether further reductions might be required, 2015 levels of purse seine effort and longline catch sat somewhere between ‘2016 choices’ and the ‘optimistic’ scenario, but the question was whether 2015 conditions and positive recruitments would continue for the next seven or eight years. Thirdly, SPC noted that there was the possibility of some bias in the estimates of early recruitment in the bigeye tuna stock assessment, which was reduced when information on numbers of small fish provided by purse seine fishery data entered the assessment. As a result, SC6 had agreed that the more positive recent recruitment assumption be used within bigeye projections. SPC captures uncertainty in the projections by sampling future recruitments, but had also run projections under a less positive future recruitment assumption, and that was presented within the paper. Regarding exemptions, SPC has not been able to evaluate the consequences of all the exemptions in the CMM, as some were very difficult to evaluate within the approach. If there were no exemptions, it would be easier to analyse the CMM and generally the results would likely be more optimistic."
WCPFC13,345,"In response to a series of questions from China about fleet effort, U.S. territory 2000 mt bigeye catch limits, and the consequences of 4th month FAD closure on the rebuilding time, Dr Graham Pilling noted that the majority of the longline catch is by fleets with CMM catch limits, but the smaller catch of non-limited fleets has increased. Regarding the 2000 mt territory limit, Dr Graham Pilling noted that the U.S. CMM limit plus the 2000 mt limit for each of its three territories was assumed under the pessimistic scenario. Dr Graham Pilling also noted that if there was no 4th month FAD closure the results would be more pessimistic."
WCPFC13,346,"Korea provided some information to the Commission about the Korean fishing fleet’s longline catch in 2015. Due to domestic reporting data changes with the introduction of its e-monitoring system, WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 50 of 361Korea assumes around 3000 mt is missing from the data. While the reconciliation is yet to be finalised, Korea noted this may affect the scenarios."
WCPFC13,347,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that an increase of 3000 mt would increase the multipliers used in the scenarios. It might, for example, lead to an increase in the longline catch scalar of around 5% in the optimistic scenario."
WCPFC13,348,"PNA was concerned about the effect of under-reporting of bigeye catches in the longline fishery and asked SPC how the results of this evaluation would be affected by such under-reporting, and non-reporting."
WCPFC13,349,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that uncertainty in catches would affect the analysis in two ways. Firstly, identifying unreported catches would lead to increases in the multipliers SPC uses for the projections, and reduce the evaluated effectiveness of the measure. Secondly, as the projections are based on the bigeye stock assessment, changes in historical catch levels would increase uncertainty in the assessed current status of the stock; this would increase uncertainty in the evaluations performed."
WCPFC13,350,"Japan noted that para 3. of the measure provides that ‘the fishing mortality rate for bigeye tuna will be reduced to a level no greater than FMSY, i.e. F/FMSY ≤ 1. This objective shall be achieved through step by step approach through 2017 in accordance with this Measure’ and expressed the view that there was no ambiguity. Japan’s interpretation of this provision is that removal of overfishing of bigeye tuna will be achieved in 2017. Secondly, Japan understood that two elements make evaluation of the CMM difficult: the many exemptions; and the ability for members to choose between one measure and another, and suggested this be considered when developing the new measure. Thirdly, Japan stated that the current CMM cannot accomplish the objective to remove overfishing of bigeye tuna by 2017. Fourthly, Japan pointed out that 2010 FAD set levels was an important discussion point in development of current measure and requested SPC to provide advice on FAD set levels that could remove overfishing of bigeye tuna for the development of the new measure."
WCPFC13,351,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that 2010 FAD set levels was identified as one element of the fishing conditions that could remove bigeye overfishing within previous projection analyses, and that SPC has generally identified different combinations of purse-seine FAD set levels and longline catch limits that could achieve this aim. This could be done for the successor CMM."
WCPFC13,352,"PNA members considered that the 2017 stock assessment should take under-reporting of longline bigeye tuna catches into account, including the resulting uncertainty. In addition, uncertainty from the missing 3,000 mt of bigeye tuna in Korea’s longline catch data emphasised the value of accelerating e-reporting adoption and e-monitoring evaluation in the Commission."
WCPFC13,353,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that including uncertainty in the bigeye tuna longline catch within the 2017 stock assessment was possible to do, but that SPC would appreciate some guidance on how to frame those scenarios for that assessment."
WCPFC13,354,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 61, the Commission noted that the SPC evaluation (WCPFC13-2016-15) had reviewed CMM 2015-01. Para. 18"
WCPFC13,355,"Para. 18 of CMM 2015-01 the provision (paragraph 18) prevents CCMs other than Kiribati from fishing on FADs in the high seas in 2017. Para. 18’s footnote 5 allows other fleets to join Kiribati in being permitted to fish on FADs in the high seas during 2017 based on them achieving a certain WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 51 of 361reduction over past years. The footnote reads in part: “The high seas FAD closure in paragraph 18 does not apply in 2017 to a CCM that has achieved a verifiable reduction in bigeye catches by its purse seine vessels to 55% from current levels (2010-2012), to be reviewed on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee.” As SC12 and TCC12 had discussed at length, the existing footnote was not clearly worded and EU had undertaken to clarify that the obligation extended to 2017 as well. EU proposed an amendment to the footnote for the Commission’s consideration (WCPFC13-2016-DP01)."
WCPFC13,356,"FFA members supported the amendment of footnote 5 to require CCMs intending to use the exemption from the high seas FAD closure in 2017 to maintain a ‘verifiable reduction’ in bigeye catches below the 55% catch level of the reference period 2010-2012. These CCMs considered that discussion about how the reduction is ‘verified’ would be useful, and how to ensure appropriate and independent monitoring mechanisms were in place. FFA members noted that in the longer term the Commission needed advice from SC for any new measure given that catch and effort of most DWFN fleets is in decline in the purse-seine fishery."
WCPFC13,357,"The Chair noted the request for clarification about how the verifiable reduction would be monitored for those who claim the exemption, noting that TCC had recommended that the provisions of footnote 5 applies for eight purse-seine fleets – Ecuador, El Salvador, EU, RMI, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu – in 2017."
WCPFC13,358,"SC12 noted that the present CMM is unclear about how footnote 5 should be applied so Korea agreed with EU that the 55% reduction should be retained in 2017, and agreed a verification system was needed. Korea considered that the footnote was only applicable in 2017."
WCPFC13,359,"USA noted the current footnote called for SC to provide advice but SC has not been able to do that, so from USA’s point of view the prerequisites for using the footnote had not been fulfilled. In addition, USA noted ambiguities in the footnote. The EU amendment would fix one of the ambiguities by requiring – for any CCM that achieves the reduction and opts not to prohibit FAD setting on the high seas in 2017 – that the reduction be maintained in 2017, which USA considered appropriate, but USA thought it would be useful to clarify whether the reduction is “of 55%” or “to 55%”. USA considered it should be “of 55%”. This CCM agreed there was an issue of the reductions being verifiable, especially as some of the figures have been updated since TCC."
WCPFC13,360,The Chair noted the widespread agreement to the EU proposal to amend the footnote. The Chair asked CCMs if they agreed that CCMs besides EU are able to come under the footnote. The Chair noted that a way to verify and monitor was required whether one or a number of CCMs claimed the exemption – the Commission had to find a way to ensure that a CCM applying the footnote adheres to the limits. Another issue to discuss was how to interpret the footnote – a strict reading suggests a decision on who should apply it should be advised by SC.
WCPFC13,361,"Chinese Taipei and Japan considered the questions were linked – the decisions of which CCMs could claim the exemption could not be made independently because it may depend on what the monitoring system was. And as SC12 was not able to give guidance, CCMs did not know how to verify it and make a decision."
WCPFC13,362,"EU clarified that it was suggesting an extension, noting that the footnote already applies for 2017. The main concern was how to verify, in 2017, that a CCM had the level of reduction. EU suggested it was possible for a fleet to estimate whether or not it was going to respect the condition or not but it could only be verified at the end of the year.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 52 of 361"
WCPFC13,363,"China noted that Attachment D of CMM 2015-01 indicated high seas purse-seine effort. Aside from the EU, the other CCMs listed had no high seas fishing days."
WCPFC13,364,Japan recognised that the EU reduction well exceeded 55% so it had a chance of achieving the exemption; the question was the other fleets which had not yet applied the exemption. This CCM considered they should have a plan to achieve the reduction and asked for explanation on the plan.  Japan requested clarification from SPC about whether 45% or 55% was the correct figure; was it a 55% reduction from the current level. The correct figure would enable the Commission to understand if a CCM had sufficiently reduced to be able to claim the exemption.
WCPFC13,365,"Based on the language of the CMM, SPC replied that it would be “to 55%” from current levels, noting that a reduction “to 45%” was a reduction “of 55%”."
WCPFC13,366,"USA agreed with Japan and EU’s recollection regarding the intention of the footnote – which was a reduction “by 55%”. This CCM confirmed that the list compiled by TCC12 was based on CCM reporting data, not verified data. In addition, the footnote contained no dates for when the reductions were to occur. USA commented that based on the footnote CCMs that reduced “by 55%” in 2016 should be able to take advantage of the exemption in 2017, and if that is the decision, the Commission needs to devise a way for that mechanism to work."
WCPFC13,367,"The Chair noted that the Commission had more work to do on the interpretation of the footnote, and SPC would investigate the data. A small group discussed the issue in the margins then came back to plenary with a recommended paragraph. It included a date (2015) in which the reduction was to have taken place and the verifiable reduction of purse seine catches would be 45% from 2010-2012 levels."
WCPFC13,368,"USA was concerned about the addition of the date (“2015”) to the informal small working group text – noting it was a limitation that was not included in the original footnote. Removing the date would treat all CCMs in the same way, which USA preferred rather than different fleets being treated in different ways. USA stressed that in the bridging tropical tuna measure and other future measures the Commission should limit or eliminate exemptions."
WCPFC13,369,A lengthy discussion took place about the history of the footnote. The small group had proposed reduced by 45% to a level of 55% and CCMs had divergent views about this.
WCPFC13,370,"Japan noted the lack of official record on this point and offered its own remembrance which was that Japan had proposed to reduce by 60%, EU could not accept 60% but could accept 50%, FFA proposed 55% and that is what the Commission settled on. Consequently Japan believed the reduction to be 55% not 45%. Japan expressed surprise that PNA CCMs had supported a 45% reduction. EU agreed with this interpretation."
WCPFC13,371,"The PNA Office noted that a range of views were expressed according to its records of the discussion, and commented that the rationale for the figure at the time was that other fleets would be observing a fourth month and maybe a fifth month high seas FAD closure, which was equivalent to a 45% reduction. A reduction by 45% reducing to 55% was therefore proposed and it had been taken up."
WCPFC13,372,"Considering debating recollections to be unconstructive, the Chair noted that SPC had advised that the difference between the two interpretations is that one of the members which thought it had qualified for the exemption would not. The Chair noted that the original footnote envisioned a role for SC – SC should have considered who could apply this particular provision. The footnote related to one of the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 53 of 361Commission’s most important measures, whose paragraph 18 was scheduled to come into effect in 2017."
WCPFC13,373,"EU recognised that its addition to the footnote (“in 2015”) had provoked unproductive discussions and considered that the footnote was clear, requiring a verifiable reduction and SC to review the process. EU recalled an agreement to a 55% reduction, but recognised that the rationale had not been discussed in plenary. Consequently, staying with what was written into the footnote was the best way forward. Regardless of the level of the reduction chosen, EU qualified for the exemption."
WCPFC13,374,Tuvalu considered that the official record of the discussion was the footnote itself as adopted by the Commission.
WCPFC13,375,The Chair noted that if the Commission was not able to adopt the reduction by 45% to 55% proposed by the Chair the Commission would need to revert to the original language then agree to which CCMs the exemption applied.
WCPFC13,376,"RMI advised that it would be applying the footnote, and was confident it would get through the assessment."
WCPFC13,377,"USA proposed eliminating the 2015 date but retaining the SC review. This CCM suggested that when SC reviews the 2016 data, it could complete the process. USA acknowledged that there could be no decision on 2016 data until SPC did its work in 2017, but noted with concern there would be a period of fishing in the meantime."
WCPFC13,378,"EU considered that the reverse would also apply: those fleets that did not respect the reduction should stop fishing, which would reopen the whole matter. This CCM considered that the footnote was clear and the only choice was to look at 2015 data."
WCPFC13,379,Japan could go along with either level of reduction if the exemption was not applied before the SC review of the data in August 2017.
WCPFC13,380,"The Chair noted SPC’s clarification that it could consider 2016 data in early 2017, so SC13 would have the data to make the determination."
WCPFC13,381,"Pointing out that subsidiary bodies make recommendations not decisions, China had difficulties with the reference year. If SC did the review of which CCMs qualified based on 2016, the decision on that would not be made until the Commission met at the end of the year. In the meantime, FAD use on the high seas could continue."
WCPFC13,382,"Without agreement on new language that the Chair had provided in WCPFC13-2016-38, the Commission accepted WCPFC13-2016-DP01, which maintained the existing language and added some clarifying language. It was suggested that the footnote not be assessed for compliance purposes and the future tropical tuna measure would take up the issues raised by the ambiguities in the original footnote."
WCPFC13,383,"Japan noted that this was a one-year measure and acknowledged the Chair’s reassurances. Noting that the Commission was fully reviewing the tropical tuna measure, including this provision, and would try to avoid ambiguity, Japan did not at this stage insist on a reduction of 55%."
WCPFC13,384,"In response to a query from USA about the suggested new element of not being subject to a compliance review, the Chair suggested that TCC would only have the same difficulties in determining WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 54 of 361what the requirement was and who could apply the exemption. The Chair took the view that the Commission should not push the currently irresolvable discussion to TCC."
WCPFC13,385,"Although there might be differences in interpretation, EU thought it would be useful if the information was presented to TCC. TCC could decide not to assess a compliance status, but for the sake of transparency TCC should have the data presented to it."
WCPFC13,386,"The Chair suggested that information could be provided to TCC outside the CMS process. However, the issue was left to those setting the TCC agenda to decide the best approach. No decision was reached on the compliance aspect."
WCPFC13,387,"Without agreement on new language that the Chair had provided in WCPFC13-2016-38, the Commission accepted WCPFC13-2016-DP01, which maintained the existing language and added some clarifying language. The Commission agreed that footnote 5 of Paragraph 18 of CMM 2016-01 is replaced by the following text:  “The high seas FAD closure in paragraph 18 does not apply in 2017 to a CCM that has achieved a verifiable reduction in bigeye catches by its purse seine vessels to 55% from current levels (2010-2012), to be reviewed on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee. The measures that the Philippines will take are in Attachment C. A CCM that has qualified for the above mentioned exemption shall maintain a verifiable reduction in bigeye catches by its purse seine vessels to 55% from the reference levels (2010-2012) also in the course of 2017.” Paras. 25 and 26"
WCPFC13,388,"Paragraphs 25 and 26 of CMM 2015-01 relate to high seas purse-seine effort limits, which under the measure are required to be reviewed in 2016 and a decision taken on the limits to apply after 2016."
WCPFC13,389,"American Samoa noted it is a developing Participating Territory which faces unique economic issues and has its own fisheries aspirations. It has a small and vulnerable economy that is highly dependent on tuna fisheries. American Samoa’s tuna canneries support thousands of direct and indirect jobs and longline and purse-seine fisheries that supply its canneries. American Samoa’s purse seiners have their own MSC certification and the canneries are dependent on them for supply of raw material. This purse-seine fishery is integral to American Samoa’s economy and should be recognized accordingly. The high seas have long been the most important and traditional fishing grounds for American Samoa’s purse seine fisheries. As such, this CCM emphasised that appropriately managed access must be maintained."
WCPFC13,390,The Chair enquired whether CCMs wanted to roll the paragraphs over for application in 2017 or make changes.
WCPFC13,391,"USA needed more time to consider the proposal, noting that American Samoa had highlighted the importance of the high seas for its economy."
WCPFC13,392,"When plenary came back to the issue, USA made the point that circumstances had changed significantly since paragraphs 25 and 26 of CMM 2015-01 were adopted and USA agreed to a significant reduction in high seas effort by its purse-seine fleet. The limit was well below its fleet’s history and needs and had a negative impact on the American Samoa economy whose coastal processing industry relies on the USA fleet accessing fisheries in close proximity, includes the high seas. USA stated that these constraints on coastal processing impacted canneries and support industries, and the provision of territory government services. USA noted Resolution 2008-01 and WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 55 of 361paragraph 14 of CMM 2013-07 – “CCMs shall ensure, consistent with national laws and regulations, that actions are not taken to constrain coastal processing and use of transhipment facilities and associated vessels of SIDS and territories, or undermine legitimate investment in SIDS and territories in the Convention Area.” USA noted SIDS fleets including charter vessels have no high seas limits and requested the deletion of paragraph 26 and revision of Attachment D to address the significant constraints on American Samoa."
WCPFC13,393,EU considered this proposal was outside the deadlines.
WCPFC13,394,"The Chair confirmed that proposals should be provided 30 days in advance of the Commission meeting was not a rule but a practice to which the Commission has aimed to adhere. However, proposals arise on the floor occasionally and the Chair noted that the Commission has discussed them to the extent agreement can be reached."
WCPFC13,395,"PNA members considered the high seas purse-seine effort limits to be a critical aspect of CMM 2015-01 for the management of bigeye and skipjack and did not support any changes to the limits in Attachment D, particularly increasing the limits."
WCPFC13,396,"RMI associated itself with PNA members’ comments. While the USA proposal referenced Resolution 2008-01, it did not apply the provisions of CMM 2013-06 which, henceforth, would be considered a critical measure to apply for all proposals submitted."
WCPFC13,397,"China also made a proposal across the floor on another paragraph in the measure relating to amending Attachment F, to change the catch limits for longliners in 2017."
WCPFC13,398,EU considered it very difficult to be able to assess the implications when receiving proposals so late in a meeting. The Commission did not have the benefit of SPC analysis to judge the extent of such proposals’ impact in terms of stocks.
WCPFC13,399,FSM supported EU’s views and there was no agreement on either USA or China’s proposals.
WCPFC13,400,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 25 and 26, the Commission agreed that the provisions for 2016 would apply in 2017."
WCPFC13,401,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 40, the Commission agreed that the limits in Attachment F for 2017 would apply in 2017. Paras. 28 and 43"
WCPFC13,402,"The Commission has agreed to review the issue of yellowfin tuna purse-seine catch and longline limits on recommendations from SC. SC had made no recommendations on this and the Chair suggested that if the Commission again chooses to not adopt yellowfin tuna limits in either the purse-seine or longline fishery, WCPFC13 should, by way of drafting some language for the report, ensure there is no misunderstanding in the revised measure to apply in 2017. It was further noted that the bridging tropical tuna measure could examine limits which might apply."
WCPFC13,403,EU commented that it would like catch limits to be applied for this species in the future.
WCPFC13,404,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 28 and 43, the Commission agreed that no limits for yellowfin tuna would apply in 2017 for purse seine and longline fisheries. The Secretariat was tasked with including a clarifying note to this effect in the update of CMM 2015-01. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 56 of 361"
WCPFC13,405,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-01 Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Attachment O), which will replace CMM 2015-01. 9.2.2 New proposals Japan – capacity management"
WCPFC13,406,"Japan introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP26, a proposal to manage capacity in the purse-seine fishing fleet, expressing the view that fishing grounds for bigeye tuna around Japan have disappeared and skipjack tuna has been reducing around Japan’s coasts, with small scale fishers who depend on those fisheries, and the economy and culture of small scale fishing villages, were suffering. In Japan’s view there were too many exemptions, and purse-seine capacity was increasing, while Japan has maintained its number of purse-seine vessels at 35 for years. Japan had submitted proposals on capacity for two years and this one, while slightly different, had the same purpose. It takes a step by step approach: first, freezing the total number of vessels larger than 24 metres with freezing capacity in the Convention area; second, reduce the number of vessels to December 2012 levels by the end of 2017; third, jointly develop a scheme to further reduce capacity to December 2012 levels; fourth, consideration of capacity transfer to SIDS, capacity scrapping, and capacity transfer to other oceans. Japan noted that in the short term it could be difficult for SIDS to develop their industries but in the medium to long term it could improve stock status bring benefit SIDS."
WCPFC13,407,"PNA members stated that capacity management provisions have been ineffective, have no conservation effect, and are designed to protect existing fleets from competition; they have also obstructed the domestic development of SIDS fleets and encouraged some Commission Members to misreport their fleet sizes which undermines the Commission fleet data. PNA shared FFA members’ view that the best way to manage capacity is as the VDS does, to set limits for catches and effort, and apply them in such a way that excess capacity is removed through market processes. Referencing WCPFC13-2016-DP28, PNA members noted that the effectiveness of the VDS is demonstrated by the stable purse seine fleet level, catch and effort in the tropical purse seine fishery since the purse seine fishery hard limits were established in 2012. PNA flagged that it will propose the deletion of the capacity paragraphs in the bridging tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC13,408,"Kiribati supported PNA’s position, noting difficulties with the capacity limits proposed by Japan. PNG commented that the proposal’s application of the SIDS CMM 2013-06 checklist was a little cursory."
WCPFC13,409,"Chinese Taipei noted that the Commission was discussing harvest strategies for rebuilding stocks, especially bigeye tuna, but controlling capacity was also important. This CCM noted that the proposal puts forward as a first step a freeze on capacity. Noting that the proposal allows for future transfers of capacity to SIDS, Chinese Taipei encouraged WCPFC13 to consider the proposal’s approach. It was noted that Chinese Taipei has maintained its fleet at 34 purse-seine vessels for years."
WCPFC13,410,"USA generally supported capacity limitation as a way to manage fleets, and commented that excess capacity can lead to, among other things, IUU fishing. With WCPFC not having capacity limits, the area is an easy place for excess capacity to be introduced. USA noted that effectively managing capacity required a better understanding of current capacity levels, but consensus had not been reached to do so. USA noted that the proposal would change the baseline, but stated its preference to not change the baseline; it should remain at 2012 as it is in the current measure. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 57 of 361"
WCPFC13,411,"EU noted that managing capacity was a priority for it in all the RFMOs to which it is a member and considered that doing so should be an objective of WCPFC. EU conceded it was not easy to strike a balance in WCPFC – over-capacity creates pressure on fish stocks, but at the same time aspirations for SIDS development had to be respected. While WCPFC had controls on effort, TACs and limits, EU considered that additional measures were needed to manage fleet capacity."
WCPFC13,412,"Japan stated that capacity management is effective as a measure against IUU fishing. Japan noted that it was in communication with the Scientific Services Provider about the applicable figure to freeze capacity to, though this wasn’t yet resolved, and whether it would apply to ‘active capacity’ or vessels ‘authorised to fish’ (paragraph 1 of the proposal) could be further discussed."
WCPFC13,413,"PNG supported Solomon Islands’ statement, noting that very effective zone-based capacity management in place in the WCPFC."
WCPFC13,414,WTPO commented that the capacity issue was very important to WTPO boat owners. This observer expressed the view that high risk factors should be eliminated and there should be a freeze on capacity without any exemptions. WTPO noted the need to develop ways to transfer non-SIDS capacity to the SIDS fleet.
WCPFC13,415,"While there was no consensus on the proposal, the Chair noted that future discussions would pick the issues up."
WCPFC13,416,"After discussions with several members and continuing differences of opinion, Japan acknowledged the lack of agreement on its proposal and made a statement on capacity management:  “It is very regrettable that WCPFC13 did not agree on management of purse seine fishing capacity proposed by Japan. We believe that the primary cause of the bigeye tuna stock decline is the increase of purse seine fishing capacity both in the number of vessels and capacity per one vessel. We also cannot ignore the possibility of negative effects by effort creep. Three years ago, at WCPFC 10, the Commission has agreed to develop a joint reduction plan for purse seine fishing capacity. Based on this agreement, Japan has been submitting a concrete proposal every year but has not got sufficient support again this year. Japan has been implementing all the tropical tuna measures faithfully. Its longline catch of bigeye tuna had decreased from 29,248 mt in 2004 to 17,825 mt in 2015, a reduction of 39%. The number of FAD sets was reduced from 3,162 in 2004 to 665 in 2015, a reduction of 79%. In the meantime, the total number of FADs used in the entire WCPO increased from 10,768 in 2010 to 13,932 in 2015, an increase of 29 %. Hence the current CMM has not achieved the objective of fishing mortality reduction, and the bigeye stock has not recovered as expected. As a result, many Japanese coastal fishing communities have experienced serious adverse impacts on their livelihoods, and coastal fishing grounds for bigeye have almost disappeared and catch of bigeye has declined drastically. As for skipjack, their migration to Japanese coastal waters has continued to stay in a very low level recently. In particular, migration to the western part of Japan has almost disappeared. This phenomenon negatively affects not only catches of coastal small-scale fishermen, but also cultural activities in such a way that traditional festivals to celebrate seasonal catches of skipjack are frequently cancelled. According to paragraph 7 of CMM 2015-06 for skipjack, the Commission shall consider and pay particular attention to any future recommendations of the Scientific Committee regarding potential spatial impacts of fishing on the skipjack stock, including possible local depletion or range contraction. Japan believes that there is a strong relationship between poor catches of skipjack in coastal areas and overcapacity of purse seine fishing vessels in the tropical areas. We hope that more evidence will be provided to the Scientific Committee to demonstrate this. In order for all members concerned including Japan to receive sufficient conservation benefit from tropical tunas as well as sustain small-scale WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 58 of 361fishermen in coastal areas, Japan believes that reduction of fishing mortality as well as efforts by purse seiners is essential. Japan will continue to work with other CCMs toward this goal.” 9.3 Review of CMM 2015-02 (South Pacific albacore) 9.3.1 New proposals"
WCPFC13,417,"CCMs wanting to raise issues relating to CMM 2015-02 or with any proposals to refine and amend CMM 2015-02 were asked to raise them under this agenda item. The Chair noted that SC12 did not provide any additional management advice, maintaining SC11’s advice (WCPFC13-2016-17).  FFA proposal to establish a limit for South Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC13,418,"FFA introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP13, a proposal to establish a limit for South Pacific albacore. These CCMs thanked the Chair for including South Pacific albacore in the consultative draft of the bridging tropical tuna CMM, however they consider it a better approach for the tropical tuna CMM focused on bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna. FFA members proposed a parallel process for the consultative development of a South Pacific albacore bridging CMM to replace the current measure, to be developed over the course of 2017 for potential adoption at WCPFC14. It is intended to be a transitional measure to keep the fishery stable during the shift from the current piecemeal approach to the Harvest Strategy approach. South Pacific albacore management reform is among FFA members’ highest priorities. They flagged continuing to develop harmonised EEZ area-based management mechanisms and look to the Commission to ensure that fishing on the high seas does not undermine their in-zone measures. FFA’s consultative draft proposed a framework for supporting progressively improved management of the South Pacific albacore stock and provides a starting point for implementing harvest control rules as they are agreed. The bridging measure will progressively incorporate elements on the harvest strategy approach as they are agreed, but will initially be based on a limit on the catch of albacore in the Convention area south of the equator. The bridging measure would establish proportional EEZ and high seas shares in the fishery and members will cooperatively manage fisheries in each respective zone and on the high seas. The bridging measure would establish an interim total catch limit until the TRP is adopted, to provide a starting point to work towards the new limit (from the TRP) using HCRs when adopted. FFA members looked forward to discuss the bridging measure in the margins, with the aim of returning to plenary a text that broadly describes the elements that will need to be discussed over the course of 2017."
WCPFC13,419,"In response to two questions from China, New Zealand clarified that the proposal represented a potential successor to the current measure, and sought to incorporate the current measure. SPC confirmed that it assesses the South Pacific albacore stock as one stock, regardless of whether it is caught inside or outside EEZs."
WCPFC13,420,"American Samoa noted that its longline fishery is almost entirely dependent on the South Pacific albacore stock. It was a fishery that had gone through great changes in the last decade. In the early to mid-2000s, the fishery was profitable. In 2014, the economics of the fishery became so bad that it was better to tie up vessels than go fishing. Over the same time period American Samoa lost its small scale artisanal longline fleet due to the poor returns from longline fishing. American Samoa was interested in measures that result in increased albacore catch rates and improved economic conditions for its domestic fleets, and a return to levels previously experienced. American Samoa continues to aspire to develop its domestic fleets, in a sustainable and responsible manner. American Samoa recognised the rate at which economic circumstances can outpace management initiatives. In this regard, American Samoa supported an interim TRP that ultimately achieves increased catch rates. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 59 of 361"
WCPFC13,421,"USA noted the importance of this stock, the need for a new CMM to manage it and the use of HCRs in the New Zealand proposal. USA supported American Samoa’s comments and suggested the measure should limit itself to longline fleets, as other fleets have a negligible impact on the stock."
WCPFC13,422,The Chair asked that interested delegations provide drafting suggestions to New Zealand through the week to assist its coordination of a bridging measure on South Pacific albacore. A working group was not established.
WCPFC13,423,"On 9 December New Zealand reported that consultations had not produced enough substantive comment to produce a revised draft, but the discussions had been encouraging. FFA members wanted to see a draft developed alongside the bridging tropical tuna measure through 2017, and one CCM confirmed it was willing to work intersessionally to advance such a proposal."
WCPFC13,424,"Environmental Defense Fund made a statement on South Pacific albacore on behalf of Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, SFP, Pew Charitable Trusts, and WWF, noting that their comments were also relevant to agenda item 8.4 (South Pacific albacore TRP). These observers hoped the Commission would be able to make more progress on issues related to South Pacific albacore during this meeting. For a variety of reasons, the South Pacific albacore measure has not been able to control or limit the effects of increased fishing capacity on this stock. American Samoa has said they have had to tie up vessels due to economic conditions in the fishery; a number of countries are in a similar position. These problems will only worsen unless we are able to collectively agree to manage this stock throughout its range. This should be a top priority for the next Commission meeting. While the South Pacific albacore fishery is not overfished, SPC has said if we continue to maintain the status quo the stock will be at risk. The fishery is not economically sustainable and fishery participants are being lost. These observers supported an intersessional consultative process that includes discussions to both develop a revised South Pacific albacore measure as well as a TRP and urged CCMs to work together and progress these issues for action at the next Commission meeting."
WCPFC13,425,"WCPFC13 agreed to task New Zealand, on behalf of FFA, with advising members early in 2017 of the proposed process for progressing the Bridging CMM on South Pacific albacore. 9.4 Review of CMM 2005-03 (North Pacific albacore)"
WCPFC13,426,"Shuya Nakatsuka, Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group, noted that no assessment on North Pacific albacore was conducted in 2016 so with no new information, current management advice from ISC, reviewed at SC12, was maintained. The Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group referred delegates to WCPFC13-2016-18, a reference paper for the review of CMM 2005-03 (North Pacific albacore) for further information. It was noted that an assessment is planned for 2017."
WCPFC13,427,"Later in the meeting, the NC Chair, Masanori Miyahara reported on North Pacific albacore. No substantial discussion had taken place at NC12. The Scientific Services Provider, ISC, was recognised for its ongoing work developing MSE for the stock. Next year the third MSE workshop will be held. Also in 2017, a new stock assessment for North Pacific albacore will be undertaken, and the CMM for North Pacific albacore will be reviewed in accordance with the results of the stock assessment."
WCPFC13,428,"Canada noted that the NP Albacore MSE process was making progress, and had reached agreement on six interim management objectives this year. Canada will host the 3rd MSE workshop in Vancouver in 2017, with the goal to reach agreement on acceptable levels of risk and candidate HCRs. Once these inputs are finalised, the operating model will be developed and simulations will begin to evaluate the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 60 of 361possible management strategies. This CCM looked forward to ongoing progress of this work, and stressed the importance of MSE as a component of harvest strategies for WCPFC stocks and fisheries."
WCPFC13,429,"One CCM asked what use is made of the six-monthly reporting of North Pacific albacore catch data required under paragraph 3 of CMM 2005-03, noting that a number of CCMs had been assessed as non-compliant for submitting the report after the deadline."
WCPFC13,430,"The Executive Director noted that the data are collected by the Commission Secretariat and made available to the NC and ISC for monitoring catch levels for the North Pacific albacore stock and for stock assessment purposes. This reporting is a specific requirement under the said CMM, though it was noted that there is more value in the data provided annually. 9.5 Review of CMM 2015-04 (Pacific bluefin tuna) 2016 Pacific bluefin tuna stock assessment"
WCPFC13,431,The reference paper for WCPFC13’s review of CMM 2015-04 (Pacific bluefin tuna) was WCPFC13-2016-19.
WCPFC13,432,"Shuya Nakatsuka, Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group, presented the 2016 Pacific Bluefin tuna stock assessment. Three meetings were held – in April and November 2015 and February/March 2016 – and included scientists from USA, Mexico, Korea, Chinese Taipei, Japan and IATTC. The assessment was completed over two weeks in March. The stock assessment was reviewed by the ISC plenary and SC12. The data used for the assessment was up to June 2015, at which time the stricter CMM had only been in place since January 2015. The assessment also used size information from various fisheries and CPUE indexes for the Chinese Taipei and Japanese longline fisheries for adults, and a juvenile index from Japanese troll fisheries; there were good data fits to the model and the assessment has improved. The current status is 2.6% of SSBF=0 – much lower than LRP of tropical tunas but the Pacific bluefin tuna stock has been below that level for most of the assessment period. The rebuilding target is currently around 7% of SSBF=0. Recruitment has fluctuated without indicating a trend, and fishing mortality has decreased slightly in recent years. The effect of the new measure is not incorporated; it is hoped that the new measure will reduce fishing mortality further. Overfishing is occurring and the stock is overfished. If Fmed is considered to be the threshold, the current F is at the threshold level. Future projections used 11 harvesting scenarios and three recruitment scenarios. Under all examined scenarios, the initial WCPFC rebuilding target would be achieved, and the probability of achieving the initial WCPFC rebuilding target would increase if more conservative measures were implemented. A reduction in catch limit for small fish would have a larger effect on recovery than a reduction for large fish. The stock assessment model was updated for the 2016 benchmark assessment, and the base-case model is substantially improved from the previous assessment. The results were similar to the previous assessment – the stock is still at a near-historic low level and current fishing mortality is above all reference points except Floss and Fmed. The initial rebuilding target of WCPFC would be achieved by higher probability than the level prescribed in the WCPFC CMM and the probability will improve with additional measures the next major assessment will be conducted in 2020 but an update will be undertaken in 2018, and in the years between ISC will monitor the indices. The stock assessment will be presented to a Pacific bluefin tuna stakeholder meeting in April/May 2017."
WCPFC13,433,"EU expressed extreme disappointment with the lack of progress and postponements of urgent decisions, and considered the minor progress as totally insufficient given the gravity of the situation. This CCM recalled the drastic measures ICCAT adopted, which have shown good results – and Atlantic bluefin tuna was depleted to 7% when it decided to act, not 2.6% like the Pacific bluefin tuna. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 61 of 361This CCM commented that the current depletion level and the expected interim rebuilding plan depletion level were 2.6% and 6.7% – well below the 20%, LRP for tropical tunas – and short of that needed to correct the status of the stock. EU considered that even a 6.7% depletion ratio estimated for 2024 represents a management failure for the Commission. EU expressed the view that WCPFC and IATTC are responsible for jointly taking more significant measures. The IATTC performance review contained a recommendation supported by EU for both Commissions to jointly develop a formal arrangement for shared management for recovery of Pacific bluefin tuna. EU made a number of comments about the role of ISC, and considered that responsibility for the Pacific bluefin tuna stock lies with WCPFC not ISC and scientific assessments should be the purview of WCPFC and IATTC, not the ISC. This CCM noted that the SC12 recommendation (paragraph 71) to take “urgent coordinated actions between WCPFC and IATTC in reviewing the current rebuilding plan, establishing the emergency rule as well as considering and developing reference points and HCRs for the long term management of Pacific bluefin tuna” has not been complied with. EU did not question the robustness of the ISC assessment, but preferred a different process, noting that the management advice from ISC was different from that of IATTC based on the same stock assessment. IATTC recommended that WCPFC adopt additional measure to reduce the catch of adults, which was not reflected in the ISC advice."
WCPFC13,434,"The Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group took up the scientific points in EU’s intervention, stressing that the organisational structure does not undermine the scientific results. It was noted that a 20% depletion level or LRP is not universal; among tuna RFMOs different levels are used. It was noted that a main concern would be continuous recruitment failure. While current stock status is low for Pacific bluefin tuna, the recruitment is not failing, according to new information. The Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group further noted that if the Commission wished, it could agree a higher target and a shorter rebuilding period, but commented that the current assessment is that the interim target will be achieved under current management measures."
WCPFC13,435,New Zealand and Australia expressed concern about the status of and management arrangements for Pacific bluefin tuna.
WCPFC13,436,"In response to a query about the recruitment estimate and how it would affect the timeframe to get to the rebuilding target, the Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group explained that the current target is based on the recruitment level of the historical average, with the assessment currently prescribing a timeframe of 2024. The steepness review would take place as one aspect of the next major assessment, in 2020. ISC’s conclusion is that the current base case represents a basis for assessment.  Pacific bluefin tuna – NC12"
WCPFC13,437,"Later in the meeting, the NC Chair, Masanori Miyahara, reported that there had been good progress this year including a joint meeting with IATTC to discuss the overall framework for Pacific bluefin tuna management. The joint working group meeting included NC members, some IATTC members (EU and Mexico) and scientific staff and observers, and discussed the rebuilding strategy, precautionary management framework, catch documentation scheme and the emergency rule and reviewed current management measures in IATTC and WCPFC. NC12 endorsed the conclusions of the joint working group and recommended a draft Pacific bluefin tuna measure, the main points were:  General Provision o Add the conclusions of the joint working group meeting on rebuilding strategy  Participants supported the following as part of an ocean-wide rebuilding strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna: “Recognizing that the management objectives of WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 62 of 361WCPFC and IATTC are to maintain or restore fish stocks at levels capable of producing MSY, to rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna stock by adopting and achieving step-wise rebuilding targets”  To help formulate the Pacific bluefin tuna rebuilding strategy, participants supported a request to the ISC to evaluate the performance of various harvest scenarios  Participants supported a plan for the WCPFC and IATTC to agree in 2017 on a second rebuilding target, to be reached in 2030, and to revisit their management measures as needed  Participants supported the ISC’s intent to hold a Pacific bluefin tuna stakeholders’ meeting (April/May 2017). o Increased frequency of review from three years to two years  Management of large fish o Revise to the same language of management of small fish, and  o add special rules on usage of the catch limit for small fish to catch large fish.  Management of Farming (new) o Take measures necessary to strengthen monitoring and data collecting system for Pacific bluefin tuna farming."
WCPFC13,438,"In response to a request from New Zealand for elaboration on the emergency rule discussions, the NC Chair noted that Japan had proposed an emergency rule at such time as the recruitment level is unusually low. Japan proposed a 50% reduction in catch as emergency actions to be taken in its proposal. However, agreement could not be reached – some parties thought it was too generous, and some thought it was too strict. The discussion was deferred to next year."
WCPFC13,439,"In response to a query from Indonesia about ‘large fish’ and ‘small fish’, the NC Chair explained that for small fish the catch allowance was cut by half; decided in 2014 and implemented from 2015. For large fish – over 30kg – efforts were made to maintain the catch at the 2002-2004 level; this provision is clarified to be mandatory this year. Restricting small fish catch will have a significant impact on recovery. The NC Chair commented that the stock started to recover even before the current measure started, and if small fish catch is reduced further, that reduction would contribute to the recovery of large fish numbers. It was noted that Korea was willing to make a voluntary payback from next year, as its fishers unexpectedly caught a significant amount of large fish this year."
WCPFC13,440,"EU noted that it participated in the joint meeting as an IATTC member, and in NC as an observer. This CCM expressed frustration, stating that NC appears to consistently postpone progress. Stating that the first rebuilding plan target has fallen short of what is needed to recover the stock and should be reviewed, this CCM recalled that bigeye tuna stock was considered a concern at 16% of depletion ration, but Pacific bluefin tuna is now 2.6%. SC considered that urgent action was needed in reviewing the current rebuilding plan, establishing the emergency rule and developing reference points for Pacific bluefin tuna, but these things were not done. In EU’s point of view the emergency rule proposed by Japan was not scientifically-based, and for that reason the EU did not support the proposal; it was not the appropriate action that was needed to address the situation. EU recognised that discussions on these issues are difficult, but stated that NC had failed for some years to adopt measures to better manage Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC13,441,"FFA members expressed great concern that the 2016 stock assessment for Pacific bluefin tuna confirmed a continued decline, with the spawning stock biomass now at 2.6% of unfished levels, which in their view was nothing short of a management failure. These CCMs stated that NC had failed to develop meaningful management recommendations and, as a Commission, CCMs have failed to hold NC to the same standards adopted for the other stocks. For any stock that is so depleted, targeted WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 63 of 361commercial fishing must cease. These CCMs recalled that the current Pacific bluefin measure includes a requirement to develop emergency rules in the event of a recruitment failure, which NC has failed to do so. The forward projections NC appears to have relied upon do not include any scenarios where recruitment continues at current historically low levels or declines. The most pessimistic recruitment scenario presented assumes that recruitment will be higher than the most recent level assessed, which these CCMs did not consider plausible. These CCMs called on the Commission to act decisively, and propose that the Commission implement emergency rules at this session and close the fishery to all targeted commercial fishing."
WCPFC13,442,"USA shared concerns that the NC has not gone far or fast enough in taking steps to conserve Pacific bluefin. USA has engaged through NC to push for robust science-based management measures and rebuilding plans and will continue to do so, with support in that effort of other Commission members. USA was very unhappy about the level of ambition reflected in the Pacific bluefin tuna measure NC has recommended the Commission adopt, but it believed that blocking NC’s recommendation will undermine efforts to rebuild the Pacific bluefin stock. The U.S. has offered proposals in recent years to rebuild the stock and establish a precautionary harvest strategy to maintain the population at MSY levels. Specifically, the U.S has proposed a rebuilding target of 20%SSBcurrentF=0, to be reached by 2030 and a LRP for the stock size of 15%SSBcurrentF=0 over the long term. Working in the NC with those members with fisheries targeting this stock, USA has not been fully satisfied but has agreed to a series of incremental measures towards a robust rebuilding framework. NC has recommended making some changes to the measure including to clarify that the large fish catch limit is binding on CCMs and to commit to adopting a second higher rebuilding target in 2017. USA recognized the implementation of the NC recommendation to allow transfer between large and small fish will require careful oversight and would hold members to strict compliance. With the choice between no progress and small but important forward progress, this was consistent with the Chair’s request during the opening ceremony to make progress wherever possible, even if it falls short of our full need. USA noted that not every step is a positive step. USA was one of the delegations that objected to adoption of the proposed emergency rule proposed by New Zealand because it was of the view that it would put in place a provision that was not robust enough to warrant adoption. USA was encouraged by the Joint IATTC-WCPFC NC working group meeting on the management of Pacific bluefin tuna, the first meeting of its type, which lay the ground work for a mutual plan for rebuilding and the long-term conservation and management of this stock throughout its range. The working group discussed six key management topics and agreed to request that the ISC assess 10 scenarios with a variety of restrictions on fishing mortality in both the WCPO and EPO, under low and average recruitment assumptions – a significant step in analyzing how to best manage those fisheries having the highest impact on the stock. The group’s other recommendations are being acted on by both NC and IATTC, some of which are reflected in the amendments to the measure under consideration. USA looked forward to continuing work in this joint working group to advance proposals in 2017 that ensure both commissions achieve their mandates to rebuild and maintain this species at sustainable levels."
WCPFC13,443,"Australia shared other CCMs’ concerns about the status of Pacific bluefin tuna, noting that the Commission runs a risk that its integrity and standing in the international community is compromised by continuing to fail to put effective management of the Pacific bluefin stock in place. The Commission has new scientific advice that confirms current management measures are failing to halt declines in the Pacific bluefin stock and that fishing mortality is too high. The Commission needs to continue work in this area as USA and New Zealand indicated, and needs to look to the NC to improve the trajectory of Pacific Bluefin tuna."
WCPFC13,444,"Japan recognised the concerns expressed by CCMs about the status of Pacific bluefin tuna. This CCM noted that NC members have been working to improve the stock situation for several years, but understands they should do more. Japan noted that the objective of the recovery plan was recovery to WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 64 of 361the historical median by 2024 with 60% probability. It should be recognised that the latest stock assessment results by ISC clearly indicated that this objective would be achieved. Japan explained that many kinds of fisheries exist in Japan – there were over 20,000 small scale troll fishers, 1,800 coastal trap fishers, plus purse-seine and longline fishers. In 2015 Japan held many stakeholder meetings across Japan explaining to fishers the need to reduce small fish catch in accordance with the decision by the Commission in 2014. Japan stated that it has been containing its catch in accordance with the agreement endorsed by the Commission two years ago, and it was difficult to ask fishers to make further reductions if they are on the right track, namely the objective agreed by the Commission would be achieved under the current measure. Japan noted that although the emergency rule was not adopted NC it would continue to discuss it with other Members. Japan further noted that a stock assessment update of indices will now be conducted every 2 years, which will allow for closer monitoring of the stock, reducing the need for emergency rules. In addition, Japan has a recruitment monitoring system, with information reported four times a year that will be incorporated into the stock assessment. Monitoring indicates that recruitment in 2015 was better than in 2014, and in 2016 the preliminary estimate is that recruitment was better than 2015, which also indicates less necessity of emergency rules. It was noted that unless the structure of Japan’s fisheries changes, they will not achieve 20% B0 because almost 97% of the Japanese catch is of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna. For this reason, the NC-IATTC joint meeting asked ISC to conduct several scenarios, which will be discussed in the stakeholder meeting in 2017 along with the next rebuilding target. Responding to the concerns of members, Japan intended, on a voluntary basis, to consider taking advantage of the new rule converting catch limits for small fish to be used to catch large fish, noting that reducing the catch of juveniles will have a bigger impact than a reduction in larger fish catch. Japan also intended to make utmost efforts to not fully utilise its catch quota for small fish. If this proved successful it would make further contributions."
WCPFC13,445,"Korea also recognised the serious concerns expressed by many CCMs about the state of Pacific bluefin tuna and aligned itself with USA, considering that baby steps were better than no steps at all and could lead to a giant leap forward in the future. Korea noted the stakeholder meeting which NC planned to hold in 2017."
WCPFC13,446,"EU noted the importance of this issue to EU member states, and highlighted that measures had been taken in ICCAT. EU said that baby steps do not always lead to big steps; in this CCMs opinion, NC and the Commission have taken “crab steps”, going backwards or sideways instead of forward. This CCM was pleased that the discussions on Pacific bluefin tuna at WCPFC13 were fulsome, but picked up on Japan’s point that the “Commission endorsed” the measure in 2014, noting that the Commission has no real choice – it receives a recommendation from NC and can either reject or accept it. This CCM suggested that the Commission consider revising the way it works, and the relationship the Commission has with the NC. Noting that Pacific bluefin tuna management is the responsibility of the Commission, not the NC, this CCM considered that there was no real improvement and in comparison with what was done in ICCAT, this was a failure. Noting Japan’s concerns for its fishing communities, EU recalled the situation of fishers in the Mediterranean – these were small communities, extremely reliant on bluefin tuna, who made great sacrifices after the imposition of necessarily drastic measures to recover the Atlantic bluefin population. EU noted that Japan supported these measures in ICCAT, and had asked Mediterranean fishing communities to make sacrifices."
WCPFC13,447,"Chinese Taipei shared the concerns of other CCMs, noting that its fishing vessels target large bigeye tuna. This CCM noted the efforts which had been made but expressed the view that they were not enough. Chinese Taipei encouraged cooperation with IATTC and NC to adopt more ambitious measures to address the concerns of members. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 65 of 361"
WCPFC13,448,"Tonga thanked EU for its interventions on Pacific bluefin tuna and hoped EU would similarly lead discussions on tropical tuna, especially South Pacific albacore tuna which was of such concern to FFA members."
WCPFC13,449,"In response to EU’s intervention, Japan noted that while in the Atlantic Ocean the majority of catch is taken by purse-seiners, there are small operators and Japan supported exemptions to those small vessels in the Adriatic Sea and the Bay of Biscay; the fishing communities around Japan are like those in the Bay of Biscay. Japan said it would continue to try and come up with a better solution and would continue to communicate with its fishermen, whose representatives were also in attendance at WCPFC13."
WCPFC13,450,"The Pew Charitable Trusts noted that even though the assessment period does not capture the full history of the fishery, the population was above 20% of the historic population size for several years (1959-1962) during the period. Independent projections using the ISC models show there are several management options that would lead to a population of 20% of historic size by 2034 or earlier. For example, reducing catch limits by 30% from current levels would produce a 78% probability of reaching the target by 2034. A reduction of 40% would lead to an over 90% chance of reaching the level by 2029. Overall catch totals could remain the same and still have a nearly 100% chance of reaching the 20% target by 2029 if catch was restricted to fish 30kg or greater. This observer stated that current management measures for Pacific bluefin are not sufficient to reach the goals set by the Convention or the CMM, which sets an initial biomass rebuilding goal of 42,592 mt by 2024 with at least 60% probability. Projections by ISC show that current measures, if perfectly implemented, will only lead to a 56.1% chance of reaching 43,000 mt by 2024. This observer stated that WCPFC should immediately support a rebuilding target of at least 20% of unfished size, and propose management measures that would lead the bluefin tuna population to rebuild to that target by 2030."
WCPFC13,451,"WWF, Pew Charitable Trusts, Greenpeace and SFP expressed their continuing serious concern about the lack of progress towards long-term effective conservation measures for Pacific bluefin tuna and reiterated the urgency expressed by the EU on the stock status report. These observers noted that in September, NC took a positive step and agreed that the rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin and long-term management framework should be harmonized across the Pacific and should be designed to return the population to a TRP that remains to be agreed. But very little progress was made at IATTC and NC. These observers believed that due to the lack of progress by the responsible bodies, the Pacific bluefin stock will continue to teeter on the edge of collapse. ISC confirmed that overfishing is continuing, and the stock remains heavily overfished, with a spawning stock biomass at 2.6% of its unfished level – clear indicators that the stock can no longer support industrial fisheries. These observers considered that the management measures taken across the Pacific have proven insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock and the rebuilding scenarios are far too optimistic – both a higher target and shorter rebuilding time frame are needed. These observers expressed concerns about USA’s acceptance of incremental improvements, noting WCPFC must independently and immediately take action to address the conservation of this stock. If the WCPFC fails to do so, the NGO community would call for a complete moratorium on the commercial fishery catching this stock to ensure its recovery and rebuilding."
WCPFC13,452,"Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group stated that the ISC assessment results did confirm that the current measures will achieve the initial rebuilding target of WCPFC, which is calculated as the historical median of SSB under the new assessment."
WCPFC13,453,"FFA members noted that little evidence was presented by CCMs to support continuing Pacific bluefin tuna catch at current levels, just overly optimistic assumptions about recruitment increasing. Given the uncertainty around measuring recruitment, FFA members considered that catch reductions WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 66 of 361were necessary to safeguard against further declines in spawning stock and could be implemented in a similar form to that proposed by Japan in their draft emergency rule. It would require a percentage catch reduction of small and large fish; with such grave concerns for this stock, these CCMs considered small steps not sufficient."
WCPFC13,454,"Japan stressed that stock was not declining. This CCM noted that Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group indicated that based on the latest stock assessment, the spawning stock biomass started increasing in 2010 and was continuously increasing up to 2014, which was the latest year that the stock assessment could detect. The current measure started in 2015, with a 50% reduction in juvenile catches. Even before that, the stock was increasing for four consecutive years."
WCPFC13,455,Chair noted that this was a necessary discussion due to the condition of Pacific bluefin tuna and thanked CCMs for their strong contributions. WCPFC13’s task was to accept the NC recommendations or not accept them and to consider what the Commission wanted to ask the NC to do in its future meeting.
WCPFC13,456,EU noted how little room there is for the Commission to manoeuvre. The Commission has had to endorse measures that not all CCMs were happy with. This CCM suggested the Commission needed more time to consult with others before accepting the recommendations.
WCPFC13,457,"FSM noted that it was the Commission’s role to provide guidance when it felt a subsidiary body’s recommendations were not satisfactory. FSM suggested the NC convene a meeting in the margins of WCPFC13, as has taken place in the past, to discuss more meaningful reductions."
WCPFC13,458,The NC Chair commented that without Mexico present it would be difficult to revisit the recommendations; NC should instead reconvene next year.
WCPFC13,459,"EU noted that Mexico was a big fisher of Pacific bluefin tuna but was not a member of the NC or WCPFC. From this CCM’s point of view, the presence of Mexico was not essential for revisiting the recommendations."
WCPFC13,460,The Chair noted the lack of consensus to adopt the NC recommendations and held the discussions open for CCMs to hold consultations.
WCPFC13,461,"On 9 December the NC Chair reported on the extraordinary meeting of NC which had been held on 8 December at WCPFC13 (Attachment P). The extraordinary meeting had discussed the possibility of taking additional measures to expedite the rebuilding of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock. The NC Chair noted there was limited time, and the outcomes were also limited as many NC members did not have a mandate to go further."
WCPFC13,462,"The NC Chair noted that NC had discussed with Mexico the possibility of it also taking extra measures, but the Mexico delegation had no mandate to proceed. And USA had proposed to send additional scenarios to be analysed by ISC."
WCPFC13,463,The Chair thanked NC and the Chair of NC for its additional work and measures.
WCPFC13,464,"EU welcomed the additional steps but considered them not sufficient in light of the gravity of the stock’s situation. EU felt that fundamental questions remained unsolved. Regarding the voluntary measures taken by Japan and Korea’s catch transfers, EU felt it was difficult to understand the conservation impact of the measures and the Commission should give a clear mandate to do more when establishing the rebuilding target required under CMM 2015-04. EU requested that in order to WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 67 of 361adopt the NC report Attachment E, Para. 1(c) should be amended to ‘rebuild to 20% b0 by 2030 with at least 60% probability,’ which would be a clear mandate for what to achieve next year. EU also made a recommendation relating to the emergency rule, noting it was paramount to adopt an emergency rule this year."
WCPFC13,465,FFA members could accept the NC12 report and the extraordinary meeting of NC advice as long as there was a stronger commitment to develop the rebuilding strategy and the agreed decision language from WCPFC13 included the following additional text:   “The NC will deliver a properly developed and resourced rebuilding strategy by WCPFC14. The strategy will include specified actions and timeframes to rebuild to the 20% spawning biomass reference point by 2030 and be based on triggering of the emergency rule.”
WCPFC13,466,"Chinese Taipei considered the request to amend the rebuilding strategy at WCPFC13 rather than through the NC report was problematic. In addition, the stock was not the only consideration: the Commission should also be concerned with socio-economic impacts. It was noted that the stock was shared with IATTC. Chinese Taipei suggested the Commission could instruct NC13 in 2017 to do its best to develop additional measures."
WCPFC13,467,"Japan noted the concerns expressed by EU and FFA members and commented that the conditional nature of their request meant that if the conditions are not agreed, the NC report would not be adopted, including recommendations which will contribute to the recovery of the Pacific bluefin tuna, an outcome contrary to the objective. Japan needed to undertake internal consultations to further consider the EU and FFA conditions, noting it was a drastic change from what NC had agreed in a step by step approach. Japan further noted that the next rebuilding target may not be the final rebuilding target. Japan hoped if EU and FFA could agree to B0 20% by 2034 rather than 2030 with more than 60% probability, it could help with internal consultations and that next year’s NC could agree an emergency rule."
WCPFC13,468,EU explained that 2030 date was chosen for second rebuilding target was because it is two generations. EU could agree 2034 at the limit but preferred 2030. EU would like an emergency rule establish in 2017 with advice from ISC defining hard limits that should not be broken or they would trigger the emergency rule.
WCPFC13,469,"Regarding the 2030 date, Japan noted the current rebuilding timeline is 7% by 2024 and 2024 to 2030 is only six years. Japan stated that it had wanted to come up with a reference point trigger as EU had suggested but ISC had said it was not possible. Japan would approach ISC again on this."
WCPFC13,470,FFA advised that it would be comfortable with either 2030 or 2034.
WCPFC13,471,"The Chair noted that under the rules of procedure the Commission cannot change the recommendations; it can only reject or accept them. However, the Commission could accept the formulation of an additional recommendation."
WCPFC13,472,"USA hoped to see the proposal from the FFA in writing as it appeared to be based on a proposal USA had put to the NC which had included a meaningful emergency rule. USA considered it unfortunate that NC had not been able to come up with recommendations that made more progress to rebuild Pacific bluefin tuna more rapidly. But there are explicit rules about how the Commission and NC are to interact and the extent to which the Commission can influence NC decisions and while the Commission has a significant role, USA considered the current discussions to be outside of the rules. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 68 of 361It would at least take a reconvening of NC to make the changes that were under discussion and given the detail of the proposals were beyond what the rules allowed. USA hoped the Commission could find a way forward that was consistent with the rules but also makes incremental progress."
WCPFC13,473,"The Legal Advisor, Dr Penny Ridings, explained the rules dealing with NC (Article 11(7) of the Convention and Annex 1 of the Rules of Procedure). NC adopts recommendations on conservation and management for Northern stocks. Commission decisions on those stocks are to be based on recommendations of NC. The Commission may return recommendations to the NC for more work. The Commission cannot take a measure on Northern stocks without NC but it may request NC to formulate and send back a recommendation on a CMM. The Rules of Procedure are not specific about how specific that request may be but in general it is in the hands of the Commission as to how it wishes to formulate its request to NC."
WCPFC13,474,"Japan noted that the Commission may ‘request’ NC to formulate a CMM, under the rules, and supported USA’s interpretation. EU agreed with the Legal Advisor’s interpretation. With it not defined how specific the Commission can be in its request, EU considered there to be no legal obstacle to the Commission formulating a specific request for NC."
WCPFC13,475,"The NC Chair confirmed NC would accept a request from the Commission and consider it at NC13. In addition, the NC Chair invited all FFA members to NC and advised that EU would participate in the joint meeting with IATTC in 2017. Through these processes, NC would be able to take account of their particular views."
WCPFC13,476,"USA advocated making it clear that the Commission accepted NC12’s recommendations, as well as formulating a specific request relating to its future work. USA expressed some concern about the specificity of the EU/FFA request, considering that the Commission formulates such things as rebuilding plans, limits and emergency rules through scientific advice required and deep deliberations among members. USA agreed that the Commission has a responsibility and should be making demands of the NC, but it also needs to respect the role of coastal states and engage them in formulating what ultimately comes back for the Commission’s consideration."
WCPFC13,477,"EU observed that there was no procedural obstacle to the Commission being very specific in its request, and noted it was not in a position to accept generic language."
WCPFC13,478,"The Chair asked interested parties to craft a request to NC on Pacific bluefin tuna and late in the meeting FFA and EU presented draft language related to the adoption of the NC12 Summary Report, and this was considered under agenda item 11.2."
WCPFC13,479,The Commission accepted the report of the extraordinary meeting of NC at WCPFC13 (Attachment P).
WCPFC13,480,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-04 Conservation and Management Measure to establish a multi-annual rebuilding plan for Pacific Bluefin tuna (Attachment Q), which will replace CMM 2015-04. 9.6 Bridging Tropical Tuna CMM"
WCPFC13,481,"The Chair presented a revised bridging Tropical Tuna CMM for discussion and consultation purposes (WCPFC13-2016-20_rev2), intended to be the successor measure for the current CMM 2015-01 which will lapse at end of 2017. It was noted that the Commission will agree on a process for progressing the bridging measure for adoption WCPFC14. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 69 of 361"
WCPFC13,482,"Japan noted its statement regarding fishing capacity, given under agenda item 9.2.2."
WCPFC13,483,"RMI flagged that the bridging measure should engage with the issues around ‘impracticality’ regarding transhipment, and signalled it hoped to work with others on this."
WCPFC13,484,"The Chair noted the development of the current measure included a preliminary discussion in Tokyo over five days, with members focused exclusively on the tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC13,485,"USA noted the Commission had a tremendous amount of work to be done to draft and agree a new tropical tuna measure, noting that the Chair had started the work. USA was concerned that the Commission would not be able to resolve the myriad issues in one or two meetings (intersessionally plus WCPFC14) in order to agree a measure. The new measure would be looking at the use of harvest control rules and MSE for these stocks, new ideas for how to manage them (for example, spatial management as a way to better focus efforts to reducing longline bigeye tuna mortality). USA understood that working electronically was difficult for some members so was not an ideal way to progress, but this method could be used over an extended period of time to at least advance the structure of the text, identify the issues to be addressed, perhaps work on some of the paragraphs and language that would not be dependent on scientific advice. This would ideally be done well in advance of an intersessional meeting in order to better incorporate scientific advice. Intersessional meetings could be held between SC and TCC and in October. USA stated its willingness to investigate the possibility of supporting a meeting."
WCPFC13,486,Australia saw the bridging measure as very important and that all relevant parties be able to participate. Australia would also explore options around hosting or contributing.
WCPFC13,487,"The Chair reminded delegations that neither the CDS-IWG, FADMgmtOptions-IWG nor ERandEM WG would be meeting in 2017. It was noted that electronic communication was a way forward so long as no parties felt excluded. The Chair noted the tentative timing suggested by USA and the generous offers of possible assistance from USA and Australia."
WCPFC13,488,"Japan agreed that there would need to be intersessional work through electronic or preparatory meetings; the next annual meeting would not be enough to resolve all the issues. This CCM noted, however, that October was the busiest month of the year for international meetings and while supporting the concept was reluctant to support a meeting between TCC and the Commission meeting."
WCPFC13,489,"While noting the difficulties of limited administrative capacities, FFA members noted the priority of the bridging measure work and agreed to the preparatory work. Meeting electronically was appropriate to allow all parties to engage. It was noted that FFA and PNA would also be scheduling sub-regional meetings on these issues."
WCPFC13,490,"EU suggested that an intersessional meeting would need to take place after SC so the results of the stock assessment could be taken into account. EU had no specific preference whether meetings should be back to back with already-scheduled meetings such as TCC and SC, or separate. One option was also back to back with NC in Korea. EU noted that last time after the workshop in Tokyo the discussion was supposed to continue at TCC, however participants at TCC were compliance managers not fisheries managers so the discussion was not fruitful."
WCPFC13,491,"The Chair noted the general agreement to hold at least one intersessional meeting and there was no perfect time to hold it. It was agreed that the Chair and the Secretariat explore options and circulate them early in the new year, after discussions with Australia and USA regarding assistance. The Chair WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 70 of 361also noted the parallel process for the South Pacific albacore bridging measure. It was suggested this be progressed electronically then, if it makes sense, a meeting could be held."
WCPFC13,492,WCPFC13 noted the following issues would also be progressed as part of or alongside the development of the bridging measure: purse seine capacity management and high seas transhipment controls.
WCPFC13,493,"WCPFC13 agreed on the following process for tropical bridging measure: a. commence work on bridging measure electronically in the early part of 2017, focussing on the structure of the measure and provisions that are not dependent on scientific advice (noting the intention to move MCS measures into existing MCS measures as needed). Best efforts will be made to make this electronic process as inclusive as possible. b. agree to task the Secretariat with exploring options and potential funding for hosting a WCPFC meeting following SC13, to further progress the bridging measure on tropical tuna.  AGENDA ITEM 10 — BYCATCH MITIGATION 10.1  Sharks 10.1.1 Review of CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05 10.1.2 New proposals"
WCPFC13,494,CCMs with proposals to refine and amend CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05 outlined them under this agenda item. EU proposal on sharks
WCPFC13,495,"EU introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP07, a proposal to prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea, the retention on board, transhipment and landing of shark fins, and implementation of a Commission fins naturally attached policy as the way to monitor the prohibition of shark finning. EU stated that SC has said for some time that the only way to enforce the WCPFC ban on finning is by implementing a fins naturally attached policy, and recalled long discussions at TCC that demonstrated the difficulty of monitoring, evaluating and assessing the ratio. EU noted observer reports and high seas boarding inspections which identified that finning occurs in the Convention area. EU noted that NEAFC and NAFO have adopted fins naturally attached policies."
WCPFC13,496,"Japan’s position on a fins naturally attached policy remained the same as during past discussions. Japan considered there were operational difficulties for longline vessels, especially the frozen type. Japan also expressed concern about the number of observations of shark finning and the retention of prohibited species. Before WCPFC brings in new measures for sharks, Japan wanted the Commission to focus on the full utilisation of sharks since prohibition of finning practices is aimed at achieving this objective. Japan recalled it had proposed at TCC that all available information on how each CCM implements paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 should be reviewed as a first step towards ensuring compliance with the full utilization requirement. Japan sought a review of compliance on full utilisation requirement every year beginning in 2017. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 71 of 361"
WCPFC13,497,Australia thanked the EU for putting the proposal forward and noted it was concerned about shark management. Australia had domestic measures in place that would enable it to support the prohibition on shark finning. Australia noted the divergent views but noted the issue was very high on other international agendas. WCPFC was under scrutiny and needed to come to a consensus position on the sustainable management of bycatch.
WCPFC13,498,"USA supported sharks being landed with their fins naturally attached as USA does in its domestic fisheries. This CCM considered it operationally feasible without degrading the quality of the fins, endangering the crew or over-burdening the vessels. USA considered it necessary that the prohibition on finning be upheld; it would also improve the data on which SC based its scientific advice. USA expressed some concern with implementation of the EU proposal’s prohibition on selling."
WCPFC13,499,"China thanked EU for its efforts but agreed with Japan’s comment. China did not think paragraph 3 of the proposal, prohibiting the sale or purchase of shark fins taken in contravention of the proposed measure, was practical or feasible. China asked what the mechanism was to monitor it and whether a catch document would need to be attached to each product. Without a system in place it would be very difficult for market countries to implement the prohibition. China would continue working with others to find a solution."
WCPFC13,500,"PNG was disappointed that there was no mention in the proposal of domestic policies, noting that PNG had been working for some time to get measures together domestically. PNG had wanted to see paragraph 11 retained containing exceptions for artisanal fisheries."
WCPFC13,501,Canada supported the principle of the proposal and noted the review Canada had undertaken domestically and would be moving away from the 5% ratio methodology to a fins naturally attached policy in its domestic fisheries and positions internationally. Canada expressed a willingness to work with others to look at the proposed approaches including the issues China had raised.
WCPFC13,502,"FFA members noted their concerns over a long period of time about the 5% fin to carcass ratio including SC12 advice that the application of the rule is ineffective. FFA preferred that finning be prohibited. The EU proposal called for fins naturally attached but also allows for fins to be cut, to allow them to be folded back. FFA members supported this for all high seas fishing and for members who cannot demonstrate that a species-specific weight ratio is enforceable. FFA members did not support the inclusion of additional reporting requirements in the measure (paragraphs 7 and 8), considering it more appropriate to include these requirements in Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission decision."
WCPFC13,503,"EU expressed disappointment in the lack of consensus. EU offered to remove paragraph 3 on selling and explained that the proposal did not have an additional data burden – a lot of data is already required under current data provision obligations. EU considered ratios to be unviable from a monitoring point of view and trying to determine species specific fin to carcass ratios was problematic. EU noted its fleet fishes for sharks and demonstrated that the fin to carcass ratio was operationally feasible. Regarding retaining paragraph 11 on artisanal fisheries, EU did not favour exceptions for any purposes as exceptions create loopholes."
WCPFC13,504,"China noted that its problem with paragraph 1 (prohibiting the removal of shark fins at sea and the retention on board, transhipment and landing of shark fins) related to how to achieve implementation. Sharks at their first landing may have fins naturally attached, but then they go to market countries at which point a certificate from the port state might be necessary, which represents a burden for SIDS and another obligation for the flag state. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 72 of 361"
WCPFC13,505,"The Chair noted the lack of consensus on the EU proposal but also support to keep strengthening CMM 2010-07. The Chair noted Japan’s reference to a requirement to include information in CCMs’ Annual Reports Part 2 demonstrating how full utilisation was being implemented and why it was impracticable to implement a fins naturally attached policy. And TCC had asked to strengthen the measure for compliance purposes as it has not been able to assessment the ratio. So the issue was circular. The Chair sought a way forward that commits the Commission to looking at the issue in alternative ways, for example doing a comprehensive review of the shark measures or tasking SC and TCC to do more specific work."
WCPFC13,506,"EU volunteered to draft some text for a way forward. After EU’s consultations in the margins and extensive discussion in plenary on 9 December, the following language was agreed:"
WCPFC13,507,"WCPFC13 requested that SC13 and TCC13, with support from the Secretariat, work towards the development of a comprehensive approach to shark and ray conservation and management with a view to adopting a new CMM at the Commission’s annual meeting in 2018. The new CMM should seek to i) unify the WCPFC’s existing shark CMMs; ii) take account of relevant national and international policies and measures; and iii) provide a framework for adopting new components as needs and datasets evolve. Elements that could be considered for the new CMM include: - policies on full utilization/prohibition on finning; - no retention policies; - safe release and handling practices; - gear mitigation, size limits or closures; - management plans/catch limits; - key species and their assessment schedules; - species-specific limit reference points; and - any data reporting requirements beyond those contained in “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission.” CMM 2014-05"
WCPFC13,508,The Chair noted recommendations from SC12 and TCC12 regarding shark management plans. The reference paper for this discussion was WCPFC13-2016-21.
WCPFC13,509,"Japan noted that SC and TCC had developed some recommendations on shark management plans. Japan supported the SC and TCC recommendations noting Japan had submitted its shark management plan of offshore longline fleets based on Kesennuma fishing port in accordance with paragraph 2 of CMM 2014-05 and implementation had begun on 1 January this year, including on prohibition of the use of shark lines and a landing limit for blue and mako sharks. Japan stated that it implements this plan to contribute to the conservation and management of sharks. Japan asked members who had not developed the plans according to new procedures agreed at the Commission to do so."
WCPFC13,510,"FFA members noted their previous supported for a ban on both shark lines and wire trace. While this was not achieved in 2014, it was a start and these CCMs continued to take the view that a ban on WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 73 of 361both is necessary to effectively conserve sharks. These practical mitigation measures are key to reducing the capture and mortality of shark species, including high priority stocks that are covered by their own CMMs. Regarding the development of future management plans, these CCMs supported using the template developed in Annex E of WCPFC-TCC12-2016-19. However, FFA members did not feel it was necessary to spend more time trying to define targeted shark fisheries. These CCMs preferred to focus efforts on banning wire trace and shark lines for any fishery that does not have a management plan."
WCPFC13,511,"EU supported the recommendations and the shark management plan template but disagreed with the recommendations regarding the longline fishery targeting sharks. EU considered that the plan should cover all fisheries that catch sharks not just those that ‘target’ sharks. Work needed to continue towards a common definition of what a ‘targeted fishery’ was, though EU was concerned about the prospect of another circular discussion without any progress; so it preferred a pragmatic approach."
WCPFC13,512,"The Chair commented on how difficult it has been for WCPFC to agree a definition of “targeted” shark fishing and noted the excellent work Dr Shelley Clarke (Secretariat) did at SC trying to take the Commission forward on this, though agreement had not been reached. The Chair reiterated the need for the Commission to find an alternative way of dealing with the issue.  10.2 Seabirds  10.2.1 Review of CMM 2012-07"
WCPFC13,513,The Chair noted the reference paper for this agenda item was WCPFC13-2016-21. There was no discussion under this item.  10.2.2 New proposals 10.2.2 FFA members’ proposal to amend CMM 2015-03 on seabirds
WCPFC13,514,"FFA members introduced their proposal (WCPFC13-2016-DP19), to provide greater protection to a number of seabird species of conservation concern at high or very high bycatch risk. SC agreed that the main area of at-risk seabird distribution was south of 25°S and that there was sufficient evidence to move the boundary of the southern seabird measure further north, though did not specify where. FFA members proposed a boundary at 26.3°S, following discussion at SC and TCC – a pragmatic balance between achieving a high level of conservation benefit and minimising compliance burden. Even low numbers of birds caught as bycatch in the areas between the current boundary of 30°S and the proposed 26.3°S represent a high or very high risk for already vulnerable bird populations. These CCMs acknowledged the propose would require French Polynesia to implement the seabird mitigation for the first time, and noted French Polynesia’s efforts this year to seek funding to trial seabird mitigation in their fleet. FFA members consider the proposal was the most practical option to addressing the high to very high risk of bycatch of vulnerable seabirds in this southern part of the WCPFC. It could be implemented immediately by a small handful of nations already familiar with seabird mitigation techniques."
WCPFC13,515,"China noted that the issue had been discussed at TCC, with one CCM discussing the difficulty of implementation. China had not conducted consultations with its industry so could not agree to the proposal right away, but hoped to come back on this during the meeting."
WCPFC13,516,"As a DWFN already implementing seabird mitigation measures, Korea did not have a specific problem with the proposal, but wanted to see language that encouraged coastal states to make their WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 74 of 361best efforts to mitigate interactions taking place in their waters. Korea noted CCBST, to which Korea is a party, had adopted a similar arrangement."
WCPFC13,517,"Australia noted it strongly supports improved mitigation measures for seabirds and is concerned about threatened species. Australia supported the FFA proposal, and applies – and will continue to apply – measures south of 25°S. Australia added that from its experience, these measures work, and fishing can continue."
WCPFC13,518,EU and USA supported the extension of protections to these additional areas.
WCPFC13,519,"French Polynesia was concerned about protection of seabirds and marine species. It has established a marine mammal sanctuary in its EEZ since 2002, implemented a ban on shark fishing operations and trade since 2006, and classified birds as endangered species in the French Polynesia EEZ, seabirds and some species of petrel. Establishing the whole EEZ as a marine managed area, “Tainui atea” enabled French Polynesia to implement binding measures in specific areas and for species wherever necessary. French Polynesia’s fleet has very few accidental catches of seabirds. This CCM considered it important to implement the same rules across the whole EEZ. French Polynesia could not support the implementation of the measure on its domestic longline fleet until mitigation trials have been conducted in its EEZ, and evidence of catch of concerned species has been demonstrated. It was noted that French Polynesia’s fleet does not fish in the area between 25°S and 30°S and queried why it needed to implement mitigation measures in areas its fleet did not operate. However, French Polynesia acknowledged the potential for fishery development in this area, and noted that the implementation of mitigation measures without evidence of interactions between seabirds and fishing operations would burden small domestic longliners. French Polynesia remained open to discussions to build a common and constructive proposal."
WCPFC13,520,"Japan noted that its position since SC had not changed, and the proposal to shift the southern boundary northwards was too definitive. Japan noted that all species reported were not ranked by IUCN as threatened, and there was no bycatch of Antipodean albatross and Campbell albatross recorded from 1992-2010 according to Japan’s observers’ and training vessels’ records. This CCM thought the 26.3°S boundary was artificial, without strong scientific justification. However, Japan was happy to continue discussions about mitigation at SC."
WCPFC13,521,"Indonesia advised that with the help of Birdlife International, Indonesia had developed its first National Plan of Action for seabird mitigation. While implementation remained a challenge for Indonesia, this CCM supported efforts to conserve seabirds. Indonesia noted that it is not in the range of the operation of the seabird mitigation requirements in FFA’s proposal."
WCPFC13,522,"Chinese Taipei commented that it was not difficult for it to implement the proposed measure but could not accept the proposal as the boundary was not based on scientific advice and had not been discussed at SC or TCC. In addition, the proposal would need to apply equally to all CCMs before Chinese Taipei could support it."
WCPFC13,523,"New Caledonia supported the proposal, noting that when creating marine parks it enforces alternative measures to sustainably develop its fisheries and protect seabirds and other bycatch."
WCPFC13,524,"Birdlife International commented that seabirds are difficult to identify, including those in the Wandering albatross group. Antipodeans albatrosses occur between 25°S and 30°S. This NGO noted that Japan’s national report indicated that its fleet catches species in the Wandering albatross group; Birdlife International thought they would be Antipodean albatrosses and while Japan indicated its fleet did not catch Antipodean albatrosses, they have not always been able to identify them to species level. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 75 of 361Based on the known distribution of the different species, the caught bird in Japan’s 2015 national report was identified as “Wandering albatross group” would be an Antipodean albatross; it is the species most likely in the region. Moving the boundary where seabird mitigation is required to be used by fleets further north towards 25°S would provide an urgently required greater level of protection for highly threatened seabirds known to be in these latitudes. BirdLife International noted that the Antipodean albatross, which breeds in New Zealand’s sub-antarctic islands, was is in big trouble because of adult mortality caused by fishing. It is considered critically endangered by New Zealand’s scientists. The new IUCN classification proposal would see it upgraded from vulnerable to critically endangered, based on recent data on population decline of 97.6% over 3 generations. Since 2004, males have declined by 5.3% and females by 8.1% annually, creating a serious sex imbalance in the population exacerbating the species’ troubles. Un-partnered males have been seen performing courtship rituals with other un-partnered males in the breeding colony. If the factors contributing to the species’ decline continue at this rate, BirdLife International stated that these birds are heading towards extinction within 2-3 generations, with the lack of management in WCPFC directly contributing to this outcome. This NGO considered it deeply concerning that CCMs seem unable to make such a minor concession – for vessels already using mitigation south of 30°S to also use it further north where there is high fishing effort and corresponding seabird mortality."
WCPFC13,525,"FFA members responded to comments from CCMs including in relation to the boundary proposed. They welcomed Japan’s recognition of SC12’s advice that these vulnerable seabirds are mostly distributed south of 25°S, and noted that the ideal boundary would be 17°S. The significance of a banded bird being recovered, as reported by a Japanese vessel, was noted. In response to Chinese Taipei’s concern, FFA members noted that discussions at the last Commission meeting centred on a 25°S boundary. This was dropped in the proposal to 26.3°S, in a practical bid to get a new boundary in place. It was noted that several nations would need to implement mitigation measures for the first time, and those CCMs with mitigation measures already in place were aware that it can take a couple of years, working with industry, to do so. FFA members considered 26.3°S was do-able immediately."
WCPFC13,526,"ACAP strongly supported the FFA proposal to amend CMM 2015-03, emphasizing that there is a range of species globally threatened with extinction that would benefit from amendment of the area of application, many of them listed under ACAP Annex 1. This list not only includes species like the Black petrel, the Antipodean albatross and the Campbell albatross, but also the Wandering, Indian yellow-nosed, White-capped and Shy albatrosses, among others. These seabird species have very small population numbers and are experiencing alarming declines in their populations. ACAP considered that urgent action was required to increase their level of protection, both through the effective implementation of CMM 2015-03 and the expansion of the area of application."
WCPFC13,527,The Chair noted that WCPFC13 did not have a consensus to adopt the proposal but encouraged CCMs wanting to move the forward to develop some report language as the basis for future discussions.
WCPFC13,528,"On 9 December, New Zealand noted SC12’s advice that “within the southern hemisphere part of the WCPO the main area of distribution for New Zealand’s vulnerable seabirds, especially the Antipodean albatross and the black petrel, is south of 25ºS.” However, after discussions in the margins and in plenary, New Zealand reported that consensus was not reached on where the boundary should be. FFA and colleagues at ACAP and Birdlife International looked forward to progressing this issue in the future.   WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 76 of 36110.3  Others  10.3 EU proposal on mobula and manta rays"
WCPFC13,529,"EU presented a proposal (WCPFC13-2016-DP06) which aimed to introduce a retention ban on mobula and manta rays in the Convention area and handling and live release guidance for specimens accidentally caught. EU noted that a similar measure was adopted in IATTC with the support of many members present at WCPFC13. The live release guidance was based on IATTC and WCPFC scientific recommendations and was discussed by SC. There were some data collection elements in the proposal and EU noted that in early consultations some concerns had been expressed about additional data requirements. However, EU noted that these data would be collected by observers and should not cause additional burden. EU considered that mobula and manta rays should be considered key shark species and therefore included in the shark research plan. At SC12 an informal small working group assessed the relevance of designating manta rays, mobulas and pelagic stingrays as WCPFC key shark species for data provision and/or assessment (developed at SC8). The informal small working group endorsed the conclusions of SC12-EB-WP-08 in terms of: presence in the Convention area, impact by WCPFC fisheries, ecological concerns and data availability. It was concluded that there are not enough data to undertake an assessment of the species. It was not agreed to designate these species as key shark species for data provision and/or assessment and SC12 recommended that the process for designation of key shark species be clarified. TCC12 confirmed that the process for designating key shark species allows for a species to be designated for assessment purposes only, to enable an assessment of the conservation status of these species. EU commented that key elements of its proposal, like the designation of manta rays and mobulas as key shark species and the adoption of guidelines for safe release of these species are a logical follow up from the progress achieved in SC12 and TCC12."
WCPFC13,530,"Noting that mobula and manta rays have been included in Appendix II by CITES, Korea advised that it is investigating implementing arrangements and data collection to fill data gaps. Korea expressed concern about the enforcement feasibility of the proposed setting ban for the two species. Korea could not accept the retention ban but would work constructively on finding solutions to the implementation problems."
WCPFC13,531,"PNA and FFA members could support the EU proposal if amendments were made to the data reporting requirements. At paragraph 4 there is a requirement to collect data on catch, discards and life status of manta rays and report in the Annual Report Part 1. While the data was important, FFA members supported including it in the required in Scientific Data Provided to the Commission, not in the proposed measure. These CCMs flagged that in future they would seek all reporting obligations to be reported in Scientific Data Provided to the Commission rather than housed in measures. FFA members noted that the move towards e-reporting was an opportunity to remind fishers of their obligations to report catch and discards for all species in their logbooks. This was especially relevant in longline fisheries where fishers have complained in the past of being limited by the number of rows on the paper forms."
WCPFC13,532,"The USA largely supported the proposal but had some concerns about the prohibition on circling and retention. At SC12 the USA had volunteered to update the safe handling and release guidelines, which should provide assistance; this CCM would work with EU on these issues."
WCPFC13,533,"Chinese Taipei expressed similar concerns, noting that there is unintentional catch, particularly in purse seine operations. It was noted that a domestic law had been enforced this year on the submission of manta ray catch notification.  This CCM commented that unintentional catch could be a compliance WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 77 of 361issue and hoped this can be taken into account in the wording.  It was noted that IATTC has a similar resolution on the exemption of purse-seine operations."
WCPFC13,534,"China recalled that a year ago IATTC agreed Resolution C-15-04 on the conservation of mobulid rays caught in association with fisheries in the IATTC Convention Area. Para. 2 of the Resolution provides that “in the case of Mobulid rays that are unintentionally caught and frozen as part of a purse-seine vessel’s operation, the vessel must surrender the whole Mobulid ray to the responsible governmental authorities at the point of landing” which is similar to the EU’s proposal. However, China noted there was no mechanism to monitor the prohibition on sale so preferred the reference be deleted. China committed to talk with EU in the margins about this."
WCPFC13,535,"Japan commented that the Commission needed some clear guidance and/or advice from SC on mobula and manta rays issues. While SC had discussed the species, no recommendation had been provided. Japan suggested passing the issue to SC for scientific consideration before discussing any management measure proposal on these species."
WCPFC13,536,"Indonesia expressed concern for the protection of mobula and manta, in particular to the two species such Manta birostris and Manta alfredi that since 2014 were fully protected in Indonesia, with penalties for catching, retaining or selling them. Indonesia informed that catch of these species were reported in the Indian Ocean and in Indonesia’s archipelagic waters, and were therefore not reported to WCPFC but they were discussed in CITES. Indonesia proposed further discussions on this issue at SC13."
WCPFC13,537,"WWF thanked EU for bringing the proposal forward, and recalled that Fiji was the lead proponent of the successful Mobula listing proposal put forward at CITES this year. WWF also noted that Japan made a statement at the CITES meeting that RFMOs were a more appropriate forum to manage species such as these."
WCPFC13,538,"Japan requested Dr Shelley Clarke to advise whether the data held on these species are adequate to support a detailed assessment, noting that if data are adequate to support assessment, those species are able to be designated for assessment only in accordance with WCPFC Process for Designating Key Shark Species for Data Provision and Assessment as agreed at TCC12. Japan recalled that TCC12 confirmed designation of key shark species for assessment only does not involve new reporting requirements."
WCPFC13,539,Dr Shelley Clarke (Secretariat) replied that the process of designating a key shark species refers whether there are data to support detailed assessment – not a stock assessment. She noted there are several species already on WCPFC’s key shark species list that do not have sufficient detail to support a stock assessment but do have sufficient data to support an indicator assessment or other analyses. In her opinion there are sufficient data to support a detailed assessment of mobula and manta rays.
WCPFC13,540,"Later in the meeting EU, after consulting with CCMs that had expressed concerns, advised the Commission that most, if not all, the concerns could be accommodated. A revised version would be submitted. If no agreement was reached, EU would prepare some language for the report. On 9 December, EU brought a rev2 back to plenary for discussion. The retention ban had been deleted but the requirement for vessels to release the specimens caught by using the guidelines on safe release contained in Annex 1 was retained. EU noted the collection of data did not create additional burden."
WCPFC13,541,"Japan could not support the revised draft, relating to paragraph 1’s requirement to release specimens unharmed. Japan stated there had been no recommendation from SC to request the Commission to protect this species. Japan recognised that these species were important for some members for reasons other than fisheries, and Japan did not object to those members taking stricter action than required by WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 78 of 361the Commission. However, that value was not necessarily shared by others, including Japan, so the question was only about whether or not there was a scientific justification for their protection. Japan hoped for a clear recommendation from SC so it could seriously consider supporting this proposal. Japan supported these species as key shark species, and collecting more data without imposing additional data burden, especially on developing countries."
WCPFC13,542,"USA noted that by listing them in Appendix II of CITES, the international community recognised mobula and manta rays were species deserving protection and additional management attention. This listing highlights that the Commission should look at how its fisheries interact with other species. USA was looking to work with EU on the proposal."
WCPFC13,543,"The Chair suggested there would not be agreement on the proposal at this meeting. EU would provide some agreed language to, among other things, ensure data could be collected in order to do the work the Commission needs for the future."
WCPFC13,544,"Japan clarified that its only problem with the proposal was the prompt release provision, and could support the other aspects. Chinese Taipei had the same concern and would join discussions with EU and Japan in the margins."
WCPFC13,545,"After those discussions had taken place and the matter was brought back to plenary, EU explained that with retention ban removed all that was left of substance was reporting and designation as a key shark species, which was not really enough for a CMM. In response to a query from PNG about the ROP elements, when the coverage rate problem is well known, EU explained that these species are mostly caught by purse-seiners."
WCPFC13,546,"Indonesia commented that it had mantas in its waters, and noted that there are many mobula species. Looking at the shark research plan, Indonesia asked if there were enough resources to conduct specific studies on these species."
WCPFC13,547,The Chair noted that any CCM could put these issues on the subsidiary bodies’ agendas.
WCPFC13,548,"Australia supported the language but noted that, regarding the language about observers, Australia had moved to an e-monitoring program for tuna fisheries in its EEZ."
WCPFC13,549,Fiji supported the language but sought clarification that USA will be working on updating the safe release guidelines at SC13. USA confirmed that it would be.
WCPFC13,550,"WCPFC13 adopted the following: 1. CCMs shall record where possible, through observer programs, the number of discards and releases of Manta and Mobula rays with indication of species (to the best extent possible), length, sex, status (dead or alive) and location caught 2. Manta and Mobula rays shall be considered WCPFC key shark species for assessment and thus listed under the Shark Research Plan, noting that data gaps may preclude a traditional stock assessment approach. 3. SC13 shall review, as appropriate, a revision of the ROP minimum standards data fields and develop safe release guidelines for Manta and Mobula rays, with a view to their adoption by WCPFC14. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 79 of 361 NC recommendation on blue sharks"
WCPFC13,551,"NC12 recommended that WCPFC13 decide if North Pacific blue shark should be designated as a northern stock, based on the available information from ISC, SPC and SC. The Chair noted that there was no recommendation from SC on this question. Consequently EU was hesitant to designate it as a northern stock. Japan noted that in 2016 a North Pacific blue shark stock assessment would be undertaken, which would give SC more information and allow it to consider the designation of the species as a northern stock."
WCPFC13,552,"SPREP made a statement about its strong commitment to sustainable development, including sustainable fisheries. Its interest in the marine realm is mainly bycatch of threatened and migratory species as well as marine debris. SPREP acknowledged Fiji’s role in shark and ray protection through CMS and CITES in particular and EU and USA supported Pacific Island Countries on silky sharks, thresher sharks and mobulas – all listed on CITES Appendix II. SPREP supported the EU proposal on mobula rays, which it saw as an opportunity for the Commission to support decisions taken by CITES, an international organization to which many WCPFC members also belong. This would be a clear signal of the Commission’s commitment to the sustainable use of wildlife. SPREP considered passing the issue to SC was no reason to defer discussion. The status of mobula rays had been discussed by the FAO Expert Panel and CITES and there was no need to reinvent the wheel. Regarding bycatch mitigation, SPREP recognised the role of SC and ROP reports, and Dr Shelley Clarke and the ABNJ project on turtle mitigation. SPREP noted comments at WCPFC13 about the low level of observer coverage and was encouraged by the rapid development of e-monitoring. SPREP hoped it would be actively consulted regarding mitigation of threatened species bycatch. Due to EU’s financial support, SPREP expected to be able to provide a substantive contribution. SPREP noted that one third of trip reports this year mentioned fishing vessels flouting MARPOL by dumping non-degradable waste at sea. SPREP was on the front line of climate change and ocean acidification and noted the impacts of changing seawater on yellowfin tuna larvae. Given the changing chemistry of the oceans, SPREP hoped to see a conservative approach to the exploitation of fish stocks. AGENDA ITEM 11 — ADOPTION OF REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES, INTERSESSIONAL WORKING GROUPS AND OTHER WORKSHOPS"
WCPFC13,553,"Taking the reports of the subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups as read, the Commission considered recommendations coming from these bodies that had not been addressed under other agenda items. The Chair emphasised that adopting the reports also implied an adoption of the work plans within them. As they may have budgetary implications, FAC would also discuss them while completing its work in the margins of WCPFC13. 11.1 SC12"
WCPFC13,554,"FFA members noted the number of small working groups that were established in the margins of SC12. While highly effective in progressing matters by allowing for more focussed engagement, these CCMs considered that managing twelve working groups was a significant feat, particularly for small delegations. FFA members did not seek to limit the informal small working group practice, they sought some appropriate rationalisation so all CCMs can participate in and monitor the outcomes from the groups. In addition, FFA members commented on the volume of papers and issues to consider each year was increasing, and called on the SC Chair and theme convenors to ensure appropriate restraints are placed on the submission of papers to ensure that they are prioritised and aligned with the work WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 80 of 361tasked by the Commission. FFA members thanked the SC Chair, Ms. Berry Muller, for stepping in to fill the critical role of Chair at SC12 and nominated Dr. V. Chan (USA) as Data and Statistics Theme Convenor."
WCPFC13,555,"The Commission adopted the SC12 Summary Report (WCPFC13-2016-SC12), noting the recommendations with budgetary implications would be considered by FAC. 11.2 NC12"
WCPFC13,556,"Extensive discussions on the NC12 report took place during discussions on Pacific bluefin tuna, at agenda item 9.5."
WCPFC13,557,"At the request of the Chair, late in the meeting FFA and EU presented draft language related to a request to the NC regarding Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC13,558,"After discussions with capital, Japan was able to support the amended text. Chinese Taipei also supported it. While EU preferred there to have been a clear recommendation in the language, it accepted the text."
WCPFC13,559,"The NC Chair requested that the NC12 report include the outcomes of the extraordinary meeting and an insertion at the end of paragraph 26 that “At WCPFC13, Japan attached the Position Paper at Attachment G.”"
WCPFC13,560,WCPFC13 adopted the NC12 Summary Report (WCPFC13-2016-NC12).
WCPFC13,561,"However, in adopting the report, WCPFC13 requested the Northern Committee to take due account of the following suggestions in accordance with Annex 1 of the Rules of Procedure: a. That NC13 develop conservation and management measures for adoption at WCPFC14 to rebuild the stock to 20% SBF=0 levels at the latest by 2034; b. That NC13 develop an emergency rule to be adopted at WCPFC14 which stipulates specific rules all CCMs shall comply with when drastic drops in recruitment are detected. For this purpose, the ISC is requested to define a drastic recruitment drop and associated risks.  11.3 TCC12"
WCPFC13,562,"Noting the reference paper listing the recommendations (WCPFC13-2016-23_rev1), the Commission considered the TCC12 report, work plan and recommendations, aside from those related to the CDS-IWG and the ERandEM WG which were considered separately in the agenda."
WCPFC13,563,"USA noted that TCC12 made two recommendations relating to transhipment (paragraphs 273 and 274 of the TCC12 Summary Report) and supported the recommendations. However, USA considered that the transhipment aspect of the ROP should be further developed, taking what IATTC has done as a model. USA considered it an appropriate task for the IWG-ROP to consider."
WCPFC13,564,"The Chair noted that this would require the IWG-ROP to reconvene in 2017, and if the Commission agreed to do that, CCMs should consider whether that would be a physical meeting or an electronic meeting. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 81 of 361"
WCPFC13,565,"In response to a query about the proposed guidelines on circumstances where it is impracticable for certain vessels to tranship in port or in waters under national jurisdiction (paragraph 37 of CMM 2009-06) prepared by the Secretariat, the Chair confirmed that TCC12 did not put forward any recommendations related to those draft guidelines. However, the Chair emphasised that a lack of a decision from a subsidiary body does not preclude the Commission from taking one. It was noted that the request for the Secretariat to prepare draft guidelines had been completed."
WCPFC13,566,"RMI was asked to present a way forward if it could, and it was noted that the Commission had not taken decision on the USA proposal to reconvene the IWG-ROP to consider the recommendation related to transhipment and ROP program. This was subsequently taken up in the discussions at agenda item 9.6 and high seas transhipment controls is identified as an issue to be progressed as part of or alongside the Bridging measures."
WCPFC13,567,"In respect of TCC12 recommendation paragraph 201, the updated Standards, Specifications and Procedures for the Commission VMS were approved (Attachment R)."
WCPFC13,568,"In respect of TCC12 recommendation paragraphs 275 and 448, the updated TCC Workplan 2016-2018 was approved (Attachment S)."
WCPFC13,569,The Commission adopted the TCC12 Summary Report (WCPFC13-2016-TCC12). 11.3.1 CDS–IWG
WCPFC13,570,"In the last two years work has accelerated on a WCPFC CDS, with agreement on objectives and much of the scope for a WCPFC CDS. Work on draft standards was one of two streams of work identified for 2015/2016, which was also the focus of the third meeting of the CDS-IWG which met on 16-17 September 2016 in Pohnpei. There were a number of recommendations in the CDS-IWG report (WCPFC-TCC12-2016-24_rev1), including recommendation that FFA Secretariat lead the continued further development of CDS data standards.."
WCPFC13,571,"EU did not object to the report, but flagged the difficulties it had with the process underway in the Commission: CCMs were creating their own IT traceability systems which could be extremely burdensome for CCMs as national IT environments will have to respond to WCPFC CDS requirements. This was a burdensome pathway, complicating trade flows. EU stated that because of the “phase in” described in the draft standards there was a risk that there will not, in the end, be a WCPFC CDS (because only CMMs meeting standards could use it) but a selective legal certificate possibly leading to two streams of product – certified and uncertified. This would lead to price differentiation, rather than achieving concrete results in combating IUU for a specific stock. EU noted it is both a market state and a fishing and processing party, and considered the standards would be difficult to comply with. The WCPFC CDS exercise was different to CDSs in other t-RFMOs. Unless it leads to an e-CDS platform like CCAMLR or ICCAT had developed, it would be difficult for the EU to commit to it in the future."
WCPFC13,572,The Chair noted that WCPFC13-2016-29 prepared by the FFA Secretariat refers to the draft CDS standards and presented a way forward. The Commission agreed that the CDS-IWG would not meet in 2017.
WCPFC13,573,"The Commission adopted the Summary Report of CDS-IWG03 (WCPFC-TCC12-2016-24_rev1), and noted the update from the FFA Secretariat on progressing the development of draft CDS standards (WCPFC13-2016-29). WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 82 of 361"
WCPFC13,574,The Commission noted that FAC had not allocated budget for a meeting of the CDS-IWG in 2017. 11.3.2 ERandEM WG 11.3.2 Proposal for ER data standards
WCPFC13,575,"The updated proposal for e-reporting standards and the recommendations of the ERandEM WG were contained in WCPFC13-2016-28, specifically in Annex A. It was noted that there were two supporting documents that should be considered with WCPFC13-2016-28: WCPFC13-2016-28 Annex A Attachment 1_rev1 provides the Electronic Reporting standards for Operational catch and effort data and WCPFC13-2016-28 Annex A Attachment 2 provides the Electronic Reporting standards for observer data."
WCPFC13,576,"EU could not support adopting the recommendations until its delegation had had discussions with SPC and the ERandEM WG Chair, Kerry Smith (Australia), about the documents presented. EU was confident its issues could be resolved with the addition of a reference to UN/CEFACT FLUX standards."
WCPFC13,577,"FFA members thanked the ERandEM WG Chair for her leadership and Peter Williams (SPC) for his efforts in accommodating late-submitted proposed changes to Annex A Attachment 1 and Annex A Attachment 2. These CCMs supported the adoption of the proposed e-reporting standards and noted that many members have, or are implementing, e-reporting. Regional standards were needed to ensure consistency and data quality."
WCPFC13,578,"In reference to Annex A Attachment 2 of the draft standards, Japan noted that it was starting to submit observer data electronically with its own standard and formats. If a new standard was agreed Japan would take time for changes to its system. This CCM asked for clarification that paragraph 3 of draft Electronic Reporting SSPs (WCPFC13-2016-28 Annex A) covers such concerns of members using their own format and standards. The ERandEM WG Chair acknowledged that countries would need some time to comply with the standards."
WCPFC13,579,"The ERandEM WG Chair noted that a range of countries are looking at e-reporting to support their decision making and meeting their obligations to Commission, and the data standards represent a first step. It was noted that the standards do not make e-reporting mandatory, they are not set in stone and the SSPs will be updated as matters progress. Paragraph 3 of the draft e-reporting standards acknowledges that countries will be working to e-reporting implementation using these standards and other forms of electronically reported data and, as appropriate, hard copy formats, will continue to be acceptable forms of reporting until decided otherwise by the Commission."
WCPFC13,580,The ERandEM WG Chair was thanked for moving this important work forward.
WCPFC13,581,"On 9 December, the discussion resumed with Japan joining the consensus and EU noting its support for adoption on the trust that it will be modified with the inclusion of the language on international standards. The Commission adopted the draft e-reporting standards consisting of Annex A and Annex A, Attachment 1_rev1 E-reporting Standard Data Fields Operational Logsheet Data. Annex A, Attachment 2 on E-reporting observer data standards was not agreed."
WCPFC13,582,"While the ERandEM WG report included a recommendation that another meeting of the group be held in 2017, CCMs were not of the view that the ERandEM WG needed to reconvene in 2017. The Chair noted that one option was to ask the Secretariat to progress the issue with those members (Japan WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 83 of 361and Chinese Taipei) who expressed some concern with Attachment 2 of the draft standards and report to TCC13."
WCPFC13,583,"The Commission adopted the Summary Report of the ERandEM Working Group second meeting (WCPFC-TCC12-2016-17) and noted the update on progressing the development of draft standards, specifications and procedures for Electronic Reporting (WCPFC13-2016-28)."
WCPFC13,584,"The Commission adopted the standards, specifications and procedures for Electronic Reporting, which presently include E-reporting standards for operational catch and effort data (Attachment T)."
WCPFC13,585,"The draft E-reporting standards for observer data, high seas pocket reporting and reporting in the event of VMS malfunction should continue to be revised based on comments provided by CCMs in 2017."
WCPFC13,586,The Commission supported TCC12 recommendation (TCC12 paragraph 330) that the ERandEMWG continue its work under the same terms of reference for another two years.
WCPFC13,587,"The Commission noted that FAC had allocated a budget for a meeting of the ERandEMWG in 2017, but agreed that a budget for a formal meeting of the ERandEMWG in 2017 was not necessary. 11.4 FADMgmtOptions–IWG"
WCPFC13,588,"The Commission considered the recommendations of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG in reference paper WCPFC13-2016-32, including a recommendation that a formal meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG is not envisaged in during 2017.  The full report is provided as WCPFC13-2016- FADMgmentOptions-IWG-02_rev2."
WCPFC13,589,"EU considered the work of the group to be important and thanked the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair, Brian Kumasi (PNG) for his work moving the issues forward. EU expressed disappointment that the working group was not proposed to reconvene in 2017 but hoped that the work would continue, including on data collection, FAD marking and management options. This CCM considered it important to coordinate with other t-RFMOs, and noted that the IATTC ad hoc Working Group on FADs recently invited other t-RFMOs to convene a joint meeting which EU hoped WCPFC would attend. EU had some concerns with the research plan: the meeting in Pohnpei in September 2016 had identified five main areas of research. FAD design had been one of the research areas but it was not supported as high priority, which EU had favoured because it would have looked at biodegradable and non-entangling designs to reduce bycatch and impacts on the ecosystem, pollution and marine debris. Organisations in other fora were also conducting similar research, for example on acoustic FADs, and there would be advantages in coordinating. EU wanted this kind of research included in the research supported by the Commission."
WCPFC13,590,"The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair thanked the CCMs which met for the working group at the end of TCC, noting that not all interested parties were present so some recommendations were not to the liking of some CCMs. The Consultant’s Report on marking and monitoring, and cost implications, were the focus of discussions on research priorities. Noting that six out of the seven terms of reference were completed, the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair observed that FAD-related work could continue through the subcommittees, for example data collection through the TCC work program and research through the SC work program."
WCPFC13,591,"Japan expressed its desire to continue to work with other members on what was for Japan the most concerning area of FAD management – reducing bycatch of juvenile fish, especially bigeye tuna. In WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 84 of 361relation to this topic Japan sought TCC’s consideration of a practical implementation of definition of FADs noting several vessels were alleged to violate prohibition of setting on FADs due to possible strict implementation of the definition."
WCPFC13,592,"FFA member CCMs did not support the proposal for a joint t-RFMO FAD working group. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG has already achieved most of what it was designed to stimulate, with research activities ongoing. 85% of the FAD sets reported in this region take place in the national jurisdictions of FFA members, and trials of a range of FAD management measures are ongoing under the PNA umbrella. In 2017 FFA members wanted to focus on developing the bridging CMMs for the major tuna stocks without distractions. These CCMs advised that when trials and research activities have results to disseminate, they will do so."
WCPFC13,593,"EU could not understand the rationale for not wanting WCPFC to attend a meeting of all the t-RFMOs to discuss FADs and considered there was a lot to gain by hearing other experiences, different management methods, other research, and bringing forward best practices. EU did not see that there was any negative effect of attending such a meeting and marked its strong support for attending."
WCPFC13,594,"USA and Japan agreed, noting that it was a useful way to collaborate at a small cost and the majority of global FAD operations took place in the WCPO."
WCPFC13,595,"Korea also supported WCPFC’s participation in the t-RFMO meeting and aligned itself with EU, USA and Japan, considering there may be much to gain from such a workshop. Korea noted that FFA members may think it did not gain much from the Kobe process, but each time a stock assessment is presented, the plot which is used to describe the data is gained from the Kobe process."
WCPFC13,596,"FFA members wanted to develop high standards of FAD management in the tropical WCPO area, and suspected that a global dialogue would result in lower standards that will assist FAD-dependent distant-water fishing fleets to maintain a competitive advantage at the expense of bigeye and bycatch stocks. FFA members considered that the Kobe process did not work in the interests of FFA members and were loathe to engage in it further. It started as a collaborative process to share experiences and lift standards and went to a process of lowest common denominators, providing a forum for countries to push measures that had been rejected in WCPFC."
WCPFC13,597,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, SFP, American Tunaboat Association, ISSF, Greenpeace, WWF, PEW urged the Commission to establish mechanisms that assure timely and updated reporting of data on FADs, including on the activities of purse seine support vessels. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG’s terms of reference specified recommending a way forward on management options for FADs. These observers believed this work is incomplete. If the FADMgmtOptions-IWG is not to meet in 2017, it was important for the Commission to establish a clear process to ensure a continued focus in 2017 on improving management of the FAD fishery including substantive outcomes such as developing options that directly manage bigeye tuna in the FAD fishery. These observers stated that developing a more comprehensive approach to managing FADs should be a clear priority of the Commission. They also encouraged WCPFC to attend the joint RFMO working group on FAD management."
WCPFC13,598,The Chair suggested the Commission adopt the report on the understanding that work will continue in the subsidiary bodies.
WCPFC13,599,EU noted that the research plan was settled but regretted FAD design was not supported in it. EU did not agree to the priorities as they were formulated. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 85 of 361
WCPFC13,600,"The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair noted that the research activities were shared with SPC as part of the discussions about research priorities, to determine whether they were practical. SPC also looked at cost. It was noted that the subcommittees would continue to discuss the issue then WCPFC14 can decide how to progress."
WCPFC13,601,"The Commission adopted the Report of the second meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG (WCPFC13-2016-FADMgmtOptions-IWG02_rev2), and agreed that the outcomes therein should be further considered at SC13 and TCC13."
WCPFC13,602,The Commission could not reach consensus on WCPFC attendance at the t-RFMOs meeting on FADs coordinated by ICCAT in 2016. Consequently the WCPFC Executive Director would not participate in that discussion.
WCPFC13,603,The Commission noted the invitation from ICCAT related to the 2017 FAD-IWG Joint tuna RFMO meeting (WCPFC13-2016-35). The Secretariat was tasked to convey WCPFC’s regrets to the ICCAT Secretariat.  AGENDA ITEM 12 — ADOPTION OF FINAL COMPLIANCE MONITORING REPORT
WCPFC13,604,The reference paper summarising the additional information submitted by CCMs as a reply to TCC12 provisional CMR was WCPFC13-2016-30.
WCPFC13,605,"On 9th December, the TCC Chair, Alexa Cole (USA) reported that the CMR informal small working group had completed its work on the final CMR after a number of session during WCPFC13. The group had been able to complete assessment on almost all of the obligations. There were seven obligations where this was not possible and these were noted in the report. The TCC Chair recommended that further discussion would not progress the assessments and they should remain not assessed. Significant concerns were expressed by the working group with how the final CMR review was conducted at WCPFC13, noting the large number of working groups which were progressing Commission work in the margins, some of which were concurrent. It also difficult to conduct the review in such a piecemeal fashion. The working group put forward a recommendation that the work to review and evaluate the CMR be done in a standalone session and that the work be chaired by whoever is the TCC Chair at the time, and that the WCPFC Compliance Manager and Assistant Compliance Manager also attend, with assistance of the Scientific Service Provider."
WCPFC13,606,"The Chair agreed that the current process for finalising the CMR was not ideal and further consideration was needed. Options included adding an additional day, ahead of the Commission meeting, taking the view that the Commission would benefit from the compliance assessments being completed before the fishery managers met. The Chair noted that the measure clearly states who is responsible for preparing the final CMR – the Commission, not TCC – so an amendment or at least explicit acknowledgement was needed to implement the TCC Chair’s recommendation."
WCPFC13,607,EU proposed a dedicated day for the working group to do this complex and lengthy work.
WCPFC13,608,"A long discussion ensued as to how to constitute the working group ahead of the Commission meeting, given the Rules of Procedure. Under one option, the first day of the Commission meeting would be dedicated to analysis of the CMR; it would formally be a Commission meeting to be in compliance with the measure but in practice it would be run by the TCC Chair. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 86 of 361"
WCPFC13,609,"USA and Australia supported the proposal, with Australia agreeing that the number and concurrence of informal small working groups was unfortunate. Dealing with the additional compliance information early and finalising the CMR would free delegations up to focus on the rest of the Commission agenda."
WCPFC13,610,"The Executive Director noted that Commission meetings have formal openings before going into the scheduled agenda. Under this proposal, the Commission would work on the provisional CMR straight after the formal opening."
WCPFC13,611,"Queries about whether the Commission meeting could formally open but without the ceremonies, to ensure the Commission was officially constituted and whether the Commission could make the CMR working group meeting a special session of TCC were put to the Legal Advisor, who explained that the session of the Commission commences at the opening of that session; it can’t commence prior to the formal opening but the formal opening could be delayed by a day. The Commission would then convene as a session that looks at the CMR, after which the official opening would take place. The Legal Advisor suggested this might be preferable to trying to have a special session. In addition, it would have to be a special session of WCPFC13 not WCPFC14."
WCPFC13,612,"Another option put by the Chair was that the FAC and the HOD could convene on the Saturday, opening the Commission. On Sunday the CMR review could commence. On Monday the formalities could be undertaken."
WCPFC13,613,"RMI could not agree to amend the measure to have a meeting if it complicates the Commission meeting. This CCM preferred the status quo, noting the other arrangements suggested were messy and not provided for in the CMS measure."
WCPFC13,614,"Seeking a pragmatic solution, EU suggested that there simply be no concurrent meetings while the CMR work is undertaken."
WCPFC13,615,No agreement was reached and the Chair noted that the discussion could not profitably go further and closed the agenda item.
WCPFC13,616,The Commission accepted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (Attachment U). Consideration of new deadlines for Annual Report Part 1 and Annual Report Part 2
WCPFC13,617,A discussion took place on the issue of deadlines for the Annual Reports Part 1 and 2 required by the Commission. Currently the Annual Report Part 1 is due 30 days prior to the annual SC meeting and the Annual Report Part 2 is due on 1 July each year. Moving the dates forward would positively affect the Secretariat’s development of the draft CMR. 16 June for both annual reports was the date recommended by the TCC Chair.
WCPFC13,618,"Indonesia stated that it would have difficulties meeting an earlier deadline, noting that its catch estimates are only become available in mid-June, after which Indonesia begins the development of the Annual Report Part 1. Indonesia proposed 6 July."
WCPFC13,619,"Japan supported Annual Report Part 1 being moved to 1 July with the Annual Report Part 2, but suggested that for Indonesia a footnote exemption could give it an extended deadline of 7 July."
WCPFC13,620,Vietnam noted it had the same difficultly as Indonesia and asked to be similarly considered. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 87 of 361
WCPFC13,621,New Zealand noted that an extended date does not help the Secretariat and suggested retaining the status quo if an earlier date could not be agreed.
WCPFC13,622,"Australia recalled discussions last year about the amount of processing time the Secretariat needed to prepare the draft CMR, and noted the need to give the Secretariat as much time as possible. This CCM was reluctant to support exemptions and extensions as this would not help in the long run."
WCPFC13,623,The Chair considered footnotes to be problematic and suggested continuing with the current deadlines.
WCPFC13,624,"In respect of TCC12 recommendation paragraph 27, WCPFC13 discussed and agreed to maintain the due dates for Annual Report Part 1 and Annual Report Part 2 in 2017. AGENDA ITEM 13 — ADOPTION OF WCPFC IUU VESSEL LIST"
WCPFC13,625,Adoption of the 2017 WCPFC IUU Vessel List took place under agenda item 6. The 2017 WCPFC IUU Vessel List is attached at Attachment L. AGENDA ITEM 14 — REPORT OF THE TENTH FINANCE  AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 14.1 Report of the Tenth Finance and Administration Committee (FAC10)
WCPFC13,626,"The Commission considered the report of FAC10 (WCPFC13-2016-FAC10). The FAC Co-Chair Paul Callaghan (USA) thanked those CCMs that participated in the FAC sessions on 4, 7, 8 and 9 December 2016, some of which went late into the night, and Secretariat staff for their strong support of those sessions. Main recommendations included: the transfer of $100,000 from the Cooperating Non-Members Fund to the SRF to support the SRF for 2017 and the establishment of a virtual intersessional working group to review the current guidelines for the SRF; the conduct of a performance-based salary review for the Executive Director; a 2% increase for professional staff including the Executive Director; and interim support for establishing an E-reporting and E-monitoring technical coordinator position."
WCPFC13,627,"Japan noted that FAC10 did not reach consensus on funding for “Skipjack impacts on the margins of the Convention Area” with only one CCM strongly supporting its inclusion in the budget – Japan. Japan reported that it would implement the project itself in 2017 and so was able to join the consensus to remove the budget of the project from the Commission’s budget. Japan would report back to the Commission, perhaps at SC13."
WCPFC13,628,EU suggested that there might be areas where economies can be realised rather than spending hours in budget meetings trying square the circle of growing demands and limited resources. This CCM suggested a performance review could be beneficial.
WCPFC13,629,"The Commission adopted the Report of the Tenth Session of the FAC (WCPFC13-2016-FAC10) (Attachment V), including the eventual 2017 budget of USD $7,774,392 and indicative budgets for 2018 and 2019 of USD 8,174,205 and USD 8,201,857 respectively (Attachment W).  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 88 of 361AGENDA ITEM 15 — ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 15.1 Strategic Plan"
WCPFC13,630,"The Commission considered the draft Strategic Plan for the Commission and Commission Secretariat. The Executive Director introduced it and offered some context around it. In 2010, six years after coming into existence, the Commission adopted a strategic plan. It was a three-year planning document, to 2013. WCPFC10 did not adopt the successor put forward by the Secretariat. The Commission considered that the lapsing Strategic Plan had not provided strategic guidance to the Commission, being more like a short term business plan and a consolidation of the SC and TCC work plans. There was a concern that it was a Secretariat-driven plan, with members lacking ownership and stakeholders not really contributing to its development. The Executive Director then made the Strategic Plan a priority and put a paper to WCPFC12 for a process to develop a more appropriate draft. That process was approved and is attached to WCPFC13-2016-31. The process was open and participatory, an independent facilitator helped develop the new draft plan and a workshop for members was held. The Executive Director explained that the Convention would remain the foundational document of the Commission. The Strategic Plan would set strategic directions over 10 years, prioritize priorities, guide the allocation of Commission resources and leverage the sourcing of additional resources. It would be supported by a shorter term Corporate Plan, to operationalise the Strategic Plan. The work plans of the SC and TCC and other subsidiary bodies would be required to strongly align with the Strategic Plan. From the Secretariat’s perceptive, such a corporate document would help them pursue additional resources from the many funding sources available."
WCPFC13,631,"With agreement to engage an independent facilitator, the Secretariat had tendered a consultancy. The Consensus Building Institute won the consultancy and collated the initial data and material. The high level strategic goals outlined in the draft Strategic Plan prepared by the consultancy were:  Adopt and implement harvest strategies and other tools to conserve and sustainably utilize fish stocks and manage interactions with the environment  Enhance compliance with conservation and management measures  Implement ecosystem-based management  Strengthen capacity of developing states, in particular small island developing states and territories, to manage and develop their tuna fisheries, and  Enhance Commission operations by deploying best available data and science and by enhancing transparency of Commission governance and operations."
WCPFC13,632,"EU welcomed the exercise, but noted that the difficult issues for the Commission are not addressed in the Strategic Plan. While all the goals were in line with the Convention, and noting the common goal of sustainable management of Western and Central Pacific fisheries, EU considered that it was not drafted in a way which was going to solve the Commission’s problems – with alternative managing measures adopted by subregional organisations and no real dialogue."
WCPFC13,633,"Japan also considered it a good exercise, but stressed that in future work on the Strategic Plan, anything beyond the Convention text would not be supported by Japan. This CCM suggested that plan was a living document.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 89 of 361"
WCPFC13,634,"FFA members outlined their views on the Strategic Plan in WCPFC13-2016-DP18: the process did not cater well to SIDS interests; the Strategic Plan must identify the highest priority elements of the Convention and help implement them; the current draft did not represent a viable way forward due to major policy differences that cannot be reconciled within a consensus set of priorities in the short term. FFA members were committed to working on a Strategic Plan and a Corporate Plan to guide and prioritise the work and resources of the Secretariat. These CCMs suggested instead of trying to agree on the current draft, WCPFC13 should identify a small number of agreeable strategic priorities that would comprise a Corporate Plan. The high priority strategic issues that FFA members wanted the Commission to focus on over the 10 years are: the protection of SIDS’ rights and interests, including through levelling the playing field through more effective implementation of Article 8; putting Harvest Strategies in place for all key tuna stocks or fisheries, which would help solve some of the Commission’s decision-making problems; improve the efficiency of CCM participation in WCPFC, including improving the ability of CCMs to comply with Commission obligations; the continual improvement in scientific advice based on enhanced fisheries-dependent data and fisheries independent research."
WCPFC13,635,"The Chair noted that the Commission was not in agreement to adopt the draft Strategic Plan, and the Commission discussed what decisions or process should flow from WCPFC13. As it was a living document, one CCM observed that it did not need to be adopted."
WCPFC13,636,"Australia agreed the plan needed more work, and indicated its support for whatever process was established. This CCM considered the FFA high priority strategic issues to be worthwhile. Australia reminded the Commission that the world is changing and the context in which fisheries management takes place needs to be taken into account – this included work in other fora which was important in planning the work of WCPFC."
WCPFC13,637,"The draft was not as detailed as USA had hoped for, and was missing issues USA had raised in its comments, such as capacity management. While not supportive of adoption of the presented version, USA acknowledged the importance of trying to develop a Strategic Plan for the Commission, to give members and the Secretariat clear guidance. USA recommended that work to further develop the Strategic Plan should be done by CCMs, not consultants, and was willing to contribute significantly to try and progress it over the next year with CCMs and the Secretariat."
WCPFC13,638,"The Chair and the Executive Director noted the partial acceptance by the Commission of the work done so far and that it should be done by CCMs and the Secretariat going forward. It was confirmed that no resources were presently dedicated to this work for forward years. The Commission decided to move ahead mostly electronically and if a more advanced product came of it, WCPFC14 could consider it."
WCPFC13,639,The Commission noted the draft Strategic Plan prepared by Consensus Building Institute (WCPFC13-2016-31).
WCPFC13,640,The Commission acknowledged progress on the draft Strategic Plan and tasked the Secretariat to work with interested CCMs and Observers to further refine the draft Strategic Plan and to initiate development of the Corporate Plan. 15.2 Participation of Observers
WCPFC13,641,"The Commission Legal Advisor (Dr Penny Ridings) presented a discussion paper on the participation of observers in meetings and activities of the Commission (WCPFC13-2016-33), as requested by WCPFC12. The paper outlined the increase in the number of WPCFC observers and the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 90 of 361numbers of attendees at WCPFC meetings. In comparison with other t-RFMOs with a comparable number of observers, there was significantly higher number of NGO participants attending WCPFC Commission meetings. The Legal Advisor noted that while it would not be consistent with the Convention’s promotion of transparency to restrict the accreditation of observers or limit further their participation at WCPFC, concerns had been expressed about the number of attendees at meetings, due to the additional costs on the Secretariat and hosts of Commission meetings. Both IATTC and ICCAT set a fee for observer participation, and IOTC can under its Rules of Procedure. There are different methods for determining the level of any observer participation fee but the Secretariat suggested that if the Commission decides to establish a participation fee for Commission meetings, the approach in other tuna RFMOs should be adopted whereby the Executive Director sets a reasonable fee for observers participation. The Secretariat invited the Commission to consider whether any fee should be applied to NGO observers, but not to intergovernmental or non-parties including CNMs. WCPFC12 and TCC12 requested that the paper consider the issue of transparency, in particular access to meeting information and non-public domain data. The Legal Advisor noted that consideration of the draft CMR occurs in a closed working group session at TCC, based on the WCPFC’s data confidentiality rules and the fact that some CCMs had not agreed to have non-public domain data presented in open session. It was suggested that the Commission could consider the participation in closed sessions of IGO and NGO representatives subject to their meeting the WCPFC’s data protection rules, including maintaining the confidentiality of the discussions, not using the information provided for any other purpose, and not commenting publicly on any information obtained through access to the meetings. Sanctions for non-compliance with the requirements could be imposed. Para. 59 of the paper, sub-points A-F, set out guidelines that could be adopted along these lines."
WCPFC13,642,"EU noted that it has long supported the inclusion of observers in all aspects of the Commission’s work as they are valuable to the discussions, stating that WCPFC is the only t-RFMO that excludes observers from its compliance process. This CCM took the position that observers should be allowed to participate in the process, and transparency should not be conditional on fees being paid. However, EU acknowledged observers represent a cost to the Commission in requiring bigger venues and other costs so they should contribute."
WCPFC13,643,"Japan also supported the idea of observers paying a fee to participate, noting that other RFMOs have started the practice and currently the Commission picks up these extra costs. The fee should not be high but should cover the costs. Japan and USA felt the Executive Director could come up with an appropriate figure, taking into account the fees set by other organisations. USA also noted the importance of observer participation to transparency and their contribution to the successful work of RFMOs."
WCPFC13,644,"The Chair noted that the issue of NGO participation in the draft CMR sessions at TCC had been under discussion for some years and TCC spends time each year trying to determine whether they should be included. There were mixed views this year, and the fourth recommendation in WCPFC13-2016-33 sought to address this particular issue in the hope that it could be resolved."
WCPFC13,645,"Japan considered it useful for NGOs to attend the compliance session and, based on experiences at other RFMOs, noted that NGOs can provide information on possible non-compliance of members. Japan works with them on these issues. The proposed guidelines in paragraph 59 addressed confidentiality of information and Japan supported their development to address members’ concerns while allowing access to the CMR session for NGOs."
WCPFC13,646,"The Chair noted that the Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the Commission (the data rules) already include confidentiality arrangements. If WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 91 of 361agreement could be reached at WCPFC13, the Secretariat would develop the guidelines intersessionally."
WCPFC13,647,"USA took the view that a general presumption of access and transparency was the best policy, including for TCC, noting that this presumption applies in other organisations and has worked well. This CCM noted that there are circumstances in which confidential information needs to be discussed. Guidelines would allow the Chair to decide to discuss issues in closed session; they should not focus strictly on the TCC draft CMR discussions."
WCPFC13,648,"EU agreed with all the points in paragraph 59 and suggested formalising them, noting that observers would also have to agree with the guidelines. EU hoped it would not take another year to adopt them and suggested for the process to be finalised intersessionally, so that observers could be allowed to participate to next meetings."
WCPFC13,649,Australia was concerned that any new guidelines do not get confused with the existing provisions under paragraph 30 of the data rules about non-public domain data. Those procedures should be taken into account when preparing the guidelines. Australia commented that guidelines enabling broader observer participation should not need to wait for WCPFC14 to adopt them.
WCPFC13,650,"International Environmental Law Project (IELP) made an intervention on behalf of the IELP, American Tuna Boat Owners Association, BirdLife, Conservation International, Greenpeace, International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, PEW, SFP, and WWF. It was noted that observers provide substantial on-the-ground support through technical workshops and purchase of equipment, and technical expertise to CCMs. As such they are integral to the implementation of the Commission’s mandate. These observers did not object to reasonable fees for participation in annual Commission meetings (not TCC or SC, as NGO participation in these meetings is low) but wanted to ensure that NGOs from Pacific Island developing states are not disproportionately burdened. It was suggested that the first two representatives from any observer organization participate without paying a fee, with each additional representative charged a reasonable fee based on the incremental cost of observer participation. These observers did not believe that additional fees are warranted for participation in meetings of the Technical and Compliance Committee and the Scientific Committee. Consistent with Article 21 of the Convention, these observers took the view that NGOs should be allowed to participate fully in TCC meetings, including the CMR sessions; other RFMOs and multilateral environmental agreements allow NGO observers to do so. It would be best practice. To participate meaningfully in CMS discussions observers would need access to material including the draft CMR and other non-public domain information. These observers were not convinced of the need for a non-disclosure agreement, as the data rules cover confidentiality of CMR-related information but would do so if needed to gain the trust of CCMs and access to TCC discussions. If the Commission contemplates sanctions against observers for violations of the confidentiality rules, these observers felt the Commission should then establish a process for evaluating alleged breaches, to ensure fairness and transparency."
WCPFC13,651,"Noting that the Commission data rules are more limiting than those what is laid out in paragraph 59, USA noted that the definition of ‘documentation’ in sub-point c was unclear – in receiving the draft CMR, members are subject to the terms of the data rules. USA would be concerned if it were that material that is referred to in sub-point c."
WCPFC13,652,The Legal Advisor responded that the suggested guidelines in paragraph 59 were intended to be consistent with the data rules and the Secretariat would ensure the guidelines met the data rules. The Legal Advisor noted that the decision to open a meeting would be an acceptance that the data provided would be able to seen by others in that meeting. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 92 of 361
WCPFC13,653,"Fiji supported moving things forward, recognising that the Commission benefited from NGOs. Fiji wondered why no requests by observers for non-public domain data had been made and whether it was due to the difficulty of the process. If so, Fiji would not support having open sessions. This CCM asked what else needed to be in place before observers were allowed into closed sessions and what implications would accrue to observers if they that divulge information after signing the non-disclosure agreement. This CCM reminded delegates that draft CMR closed sessions handle information in its raw form, some of which are not cleared until the subsequent Commission meeting, and noted that if this information is released, damage to a member’s reputation could be irreversible."
WCPFC13,654,"USA offered to work with interested parties intersessionally, using WCPFC13-2016-33 as a basis. Australia and Fiji indicated they would work with USA on the guidelines. Fiji also suggested an additional paragraph that participants would need to be invited, and they would qualify for this invitation by having helped CCMs, as this signalled genuine interest. However, this was not taken up by the Commission."
WCPFC13,655,"The Commission recognized Article 21 of the WCPFC Convention, which provides for the Commission to promote transparency in its decision-making processes and other activities."
WCPFC13,656,"The Commission agreed that observers from non-governmental organizations will be required to pay a reasonable fee for participation at meetings of the Commission to contribute to the additional expenses generated by their participation, as determined annually by the Executive Director taking into account international practice."
WCPFC13,657,"The Commission agreed that the fee would be charged on registration and would be charged only for participation at Commission meetings, unless otherwise decided by the Commission."
WCPFC13,658,"The Commission agreed to develop and adopt intersessionally in time for use at TCC13 guidelines to enable the participation of NGO observers at closed meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies under conditions which would ensure the confidentiality and non-disclosure of any information learned as a result of that participation, and sanctions for failure to comply with the rules and procedures relating to participation. 15.3 Memoranda of Cooperation with CCSBT"
WCPFC13,659,"The Commission considered two proposed draft Memoranda of Cooperation (MoC) with the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), on: exchange and release of data; and endorsement of WCPFC ROP observers for observing transhipments of southern bluefin tuna on the high seas of the WCPFC Convention Area. The WCPFC Compliance Manager noted that both MoC had been endorsed by CCSBT and were tabled at TCC12, which supported them being forwarded to the Commission for consideration."
WCPFC13,660,"Japan requested that the square brackets around “at least” be removed from the draft conditions for the exchange of data. Subsequently, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei supported the adoption of the MoC between the two RFMOs, citing their participation in CCSBT. Korea observed that the MoC could be mutually beneficial for both organisations as CCSBT moves towards quantifying all sources of mortality and as WCPFC moves towards harvest control rules."
WCPFC13,661,"FFA members supported the proposed MoC with CCSBT to exchange and release data, with the key requirement that WCPFC data is handled in accordance with the Commission’s data rules.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 93 of 361"
WCPFC13,662,"Regarding the MoC on endorsement of WCPFC ROP observers, FFA members noted that WCPFC ROP observers to be CCSBT-endorsed would need training on CCSBT data and information requirements and sought clarification about the related costs, and who would provide and pay for the training. FFA members and PNG, as an observer provider, which operates a cost recovery model, noted that with additional skills and responsibilities, remuneration for ROP observers would need to increase."
WCPFC13,663,The WCPFC Compliance Manager responded that there was no formal arrangement within the MoC for how training would occur and referred the Commission to paragraph 7 of the MoC. This provides for the Secretariats to assist in training WCPFC ROP observers to meet requirements for endorsement by the CCSBT. It was explained that if ROP observer providers wanted their observers to be endorsed they could signal that training assistance and/or support for other related costs was needed prior to opting in – CCBST-endorsement was not intended to be mandatory for all ROP observers involved in WCPFC transhipments and might be done on a needs basis.
WCPFC13,664,The Commission agreed that the Memorandum of Cooperation on the Exchange and Release of Data with CCSBT should be signed (Attachment X).
WCPFC13,665,The Commission agreed that the Memorandum of Cooperation on the Endorsement of WCPFC ROP Observers for Observing Transhipments of Southern Bluefin Tuna on the High Seas of the WCPFC Convention Area with CCSBT should be signed (Attachment Y). 15.4 Research projects 15.4.1 ABNJ Project
WCPFC13,666,A report prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is available at WCPFC13-2016-37 and provided an update to the Commission on progress of the project Sustainable management of tuna fisheries and biodiversity conservation in the ABNJ. 15.4.2 WPEA Project
WCPFC13,667,"A report prepared by Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam and the Secretariat is available at WCPFC13-2016-36 and provided an update on the project Sustainable Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the West Pacific and East Asian Seas (WPEA project)."
WCPFC13,668,The Commission noted the updates on the ABNJ project (WCPFC13-2016-37) and WPEA project (WCPFC13-2016-36).  15.5 Election of officers
WCPFC13,669,"The Commission made a number of appointments to Commission positions: a. Rhea Moss-Christian (RMI) was appointed to continue as Commission Chair; b. Jung-re Kim (Korea) was appointed as the new Commission Vice-Chair; c. Berry Muller (RMI) was appointed to continue as SC Chair, and was thanked for taking on the role intersessionally and for chairing SC12; WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 94 of 361d. Masanori Miyahara (Japan) was appointed to continue as NC Chair; e. Michael Tosatto (USA) was appointed to continue as NC Vice-Chair; f. Alexa Cole (USA) was appointed to continue as TCC Chair;  g. Monte Depaune (Nauru) was appointed as the new TCC Vice-Chair;  h. Magele Eteuati Ropeti (Samoa) was appointed the new FAC Co-Chair on the first day of WCPFC13 to ensure the continuation of the co-chairing arrangement and the efficient progression of FAC work in the margins of the meeting.   15.6 Future meetings"
WCPFC13,670,"The Commission agreed that:  - SC13 would be held from 9-17 August 2017 in Rarotonga, Cook Islands; - NC13 would be held from 28 August – 1 September 2017 in Korea, with the venue to be confirmed; - TCC13 would be held from 27 September – 3 October 2017 in Pohnpei, FSM; - WCPFC14 would be held from 4-8 December 2017 in the Philippines, with the venue to be confirmed; - FAC11 would be held immediately prior to WCPFC14. AGENDA ITEM 16 — OTHER MATTERS"
WCPFC13,671,"On 8 December, the Chair announced that UNGA had announced that 2 May is World Tuna Day and noted PNA efforts to have this established."
WCPFC13,672,"RMI flagged that it would be raising the issue of marine debris and pollution at future meetings, with a draft measure to be submitted to WCPFC14 through SC13 and TCC13. EU thanked RMI for continuing to push marine debris and pollution work. This CCM considered these issues to be central components of ocean governance to be addressed as a priority."
WCPFC13,673,The Commission noted RMIs intention to progress a proposal for a WCPFC response related to addressing the issue of marine debris. AGENDA ITEM 17 — SUMMARY REPORT OF THE WCPFC13
WCPFC13,674,"The Secretariat advised that a final draft of the WCPFC13 Outcomes Document (WCPFC13-2016-outcomes) containing the decisions taken at WCPFC13 would be available on the Commission website within two weeks. The Commission would clear the meeting Summary Report intersessionally, as per past practice. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 95 of 361AGENDA ITEM 18 — CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC13,675,"The Chair thanked the government of the Republic of Fiji for the meeting arrangements and thanked the Fijian Minister for Fisheries for his indulgence and hospitality for delaying the closing dinner to enable the Commission to finish its work. The Chair observed that it had been a successful meeting. The level of commitment was very high. This was especially evident in the drafting and working groups, some of which went late into the night. The Chair recalled that she had asked delegations to consider the value of incremental steps – these small steps remain critical to achieving the Commission’s objectives. The Chair thanked members and delegates for their cooperation, noting that through the outcomes of WCPFC13 the Commission had tasked itself with future work to continue strengthening WCPFC’s systems and Conservation and Management Measures. The Chair thanked the excellent job the Secretariat staff had done during an intense and high pressure meeting, and the rapporteur, Dr Jane Broweleit, for preparing the meeting reports that were the Commission’s ‘memory’."
WCPFC13,676,The meeting closed at 8:30 pm on Friday 9 December 2016.
