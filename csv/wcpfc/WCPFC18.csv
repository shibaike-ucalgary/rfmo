WCPFC18,9,"The Commission Chair, Ms. Jung-re Riley Kim, welcomed all participants to WCPFC18, expressing her hope that everyone was well and safe, and her pleasure at seeing everyone, albeit online. She noted that she had shared her thoughts regarding the meeting priorities in writing prior to the meeting (in Circular 2021/101). She observed that despite the inability to meet in person, the Commission’s collective efforts had kept the region’s tuna stocks healthy, and CCMs had carried on important intersessional work. She expressed her sincere appreciation to all for their flexibility, patience, compromise and hard work leading up to WCPFC18. She noted that the international community’s attention was on the actions of the Commission at WCPFC18, in particular regarding the adoption of a new tropical tuna conservation and management measure (CMM). The Chair noted the two tropical tuna workshops that were held during 2021, and the further consultations that served as input to the Chair’s Consultative Draft, which would serve as a reference throughout the upcoming discussions. She stated that a spirit of cooperation would yield a result commensurate with the Commission’s efforts and reputation, and that she counted on CCMs’ close cooperation in this regard. She observed that WCPFC18 was also tasked with a wide array of other important issues, including the improvement of the compliance monitoring scheme (CMS), harvest strategy work, management of stocks other than tropical tuna, electronic monitoring and reporting, transhipment, and FAD management.  She emphasised the need to consider at all times the special requirements of small island developing states (SIDS), who are more vulnerable to the challenges and difficulties stemming from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. She stated that the global health crisis of the prior two years has tested the Commission’s solidarity and that CCMs had proven their collective strength. She expressed her confidence that at WCPFC18 CCMs could once again successfully meet the objectives of the Commission. She closed by thanking the Secretariat for their hard work, and subsidiary body Chairs, Co-Chairs, and Vice-Chairs for their excellent leadership. Her full remarks are included as Attachment B."
WCPFC18,10,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti P Teo, OBE welcomed delegates to WCPFC18, noting it was the second time in the Commission’s history that its annual session was being held virtually. He stated that 2021 was very busy and intense for the WCPFC and its members, and for the Secretariat, noting the ambitious and substantive intersessional work programme set by the Commission at WCPFC17. He referenced the requirement to develop a new tropical tuna measure to succeed the current measure (CMM 2020-01) set to expire in February 2022. He stated that the existing measure had served the Commission well, and enabled the Commission to manage successfully the bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna stocks, which are all assessed as being fished sustainably, an accomplishment unique only to the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) region. He reflected on the time and resources expended in 2021 in developing a new tropical tuna measure as worthwhile investment to ensure the new measure continue to achieve its conservation objectives as supported by the best scientific advice and information available, while permitting where feasible sustainable economic growth of the fishing industry. He noted that the two Commission-level workshops held in 2021 to develop a tropical tuna measure (chaired by the WCPFC Chair) covered much ground, and remarked on the commitment of Commission members to ensure continuation of the management regime for tropical tuna in 2022 and beyond. He also noted the need to continue the operation of the WCPFC compliance monitoring scheme (CMS) beyond 2021, noting that the CMS is at the core of the Commission’s ability to assess the compliance performance of each CCM against obligations under CMMs and other obligations CCMs committed to uphold. He committed all the resources WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  3    and time of the Secretariat to working closely with CCMs to find a way to allow the Commission to continue to assess annually the compliance performance of CCMs while also addressing any deficiencies and reforms needed to enhance the efficiency and equity of the CMS. He stated that his 2021 Annual Report documents and chronicles the many activities the Commission and members were engaged in, both at the Commission and subsidiary body level, and various intersessional working group activities. It also documents separately the activities attributed directly to the Secretariat, which were reported against the milestones and performance indicators in the Secretariat’s Corporate Plan. He observed that the Commission and its members as supported by the Secretariat were able to deliver on their key responsibilities for 2021, and hoped that the same level of success would also be reflected in the outcomes of WCPFC18. His full remarks are included as Attachment C. 1.1 Adoption of Agenda"
WCPFC18,11,The agenda was adopted (Attachment D).  1.2 Statements from Members and Participating Territories
WCPFC18,12,"The Chair, mindful of time constraints, encouraged CCMs to provide copies of their opening statements to the Secretariat for circulation and inclusion in the Summary Report. The Chair noted that opening statements had been received from American Samoa, Australia, Indonesia, the South Pacific Group (SPG, made up of Niue, Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga), the Philippines, and Tuvalu."
WCPFC18,13,"American Samoa extended its welcome to the Chair, Heads of Delegations, the Executive Director, and members of WCPFC. In its remarks American Samoa stressed the existential relationship between its economy and tuna fishing and processing. It noted that American Samoa, with CNMI and Guam, submitted WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09 Assessments under CMM 2013-06 for Proposed and Potential Provisions of a New Conservation and Management Measure for the Tropical Tuna Stocks, which contains information and detailed analyses intended to be used by the Commission to assess the future impacts of various potential management measures on SIDS. American Samoa stated its hope that any newly designed measures will not continue to transfer a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto any SIDS. It stressed that past implementations of certain tuna management measures have had a devastating effect on American Samoa despite its status as a SIDS, noting that some measures have contributed to the continued decline of U.S. flagged purse seine vessels that have historical significance to American Samoa’s economy and its tuna industry. American Samoa emphasised that this was due at least in part to the treatment of the locally based purse seine fleet, which has been regulated as U.S. flag purse seiners, not as locally based American Samoa tuna purse seiners. It emphasized the urgent need to fix this anomaly. As a SIDS, American Samoa stated it looked forward to working with all CCMs to remedy the situation."
WCPFC18,14,"Australia welcomed the Chair, Executive Director, guests, members and observers at WCPFC18, and acknowledged the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are the traditional custodians of its country, stating it extends that respect to other Indigenous peoples. Australia expressed its gratitude to the CCMs who worked online throughout 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and commended members for continuing to progress strong outcomes through the Commission. Australia also thanked the Secretariat for its thorough preparations for WCPFC18, noting that the high quality of the Secretariat’s work helped in ensuring CCMs were prepared to discuss and advance the Commission’s wide-ranging work. Australia stated it was pleased that all four major commercial tuna stocks remain above sustainable limits despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. It stated that the Commission should continue to manage its shared fish stocks in line with best practice, to ensure they remain sustainable well into the future. It noted the tropical tuna discussions had been the primary focus of the Commission in 2021 and looked forward to continuing strong management in a new CMM, and advocated that a new measure be in place WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  4    for several years to allow the Commission time to progress other critical work. Australia stated its strong commitment to the ongoing development and implementation of harvest strategies by the Commission, observing that these are essential to achieve long-term security of migratory tuna stocks. It also supported implementation of a robust and effective CMS to monitor and review compliance with the Commission’s CMMs, and stated that having an effective, efficient, fair and constructive CMS remains a priority for Australia. Australia also extended its thanks to the Chair for her leadership in 2021, and welcomed her continued guidance. Australia closed by noting its commitment to ensuring the WCPFC continues to lead in the effective management of WCPO migratory stocks; it observed that the Commission’s success is built on the hard work and cooperation of its members, and it looked forward to working constructively and effectively with the Secretariat and participants at WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,15,"Indonesia acknowledged the Secretariat’s work in facilitating the virtual WCPFC18 amidst the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed appreciation to the Chair, the Executive Director, and committee and working group chairs for their work throughout the year. It also expressed solidarity with the CCMs in their fight against COVID-19 and extended condolences for their losses. Indonesia looked forward to fruitful and amicable discussions at WCPFC18. Indonesia stated that formulation of the new tropical tuna CMM should accommodate the rights of developing coastal states and SIDS, and stressed the importance of developing the new CMM properly and responsibly, taking into account the rights of local communities. Indonesia stated it had consistently fulfilled its responsibilities to WCPFC in preparing its annual report to meet scientific and compliance requirements. It stated that its catch limit for tropical tuna (e.g., bigeye) was not fully utilized, and it had not fished in the high seas for seven years (2015-2021), which contributed to the continued efforts to adopt a precautionary approach by reducing fishing effort in the high seas and to combat IUU Fishing in the WCPO. Indonesia stated it was contributing essential effort to supporting the accelerated rebuilding of bigeye stocks in the WCPO, and therefore its effort of managing its fleets in such a precautionary way should be addressed as a reward in relation to direct support for the tropical tuna CMM. In the context of utilization of the stocks in the WCPO, Indonesia stated it retained its right to have access and opportunity to fish in the high seas of WCPO as required. Indonesia stated its willingness to continuously improve its tuna fisheries management and welcomed any collaboration from other CCMs as well as the Secretariat to ensure the sustainability of WCPO stocks. Indonesia referenced its development of an Interim Harvest Strategy Framework for tropical tuna in Indonesian archipelagic waters (begun in 2014 and launched in 2018), and stated it disseminated annual updates of its harvest strategy progress to various WCPFC bodies. It noted the challenges it faces, and stated that it obtained many inputs and support from fishery stakeholders and experts in progressing harvest strategy development and implementation. Indonesia stated its willingness to collaborate with neighbouring countries to ensure the sustainability of the tropical tunas stocks in the region. Indonesia noted that some of the proposed timelines for development of harvest strategies by WCPFC had not been met, and suggested expediting their development, and revisiting the timeline adopted in CMM 2014-06. Indonesia also drew attention to intersessional discussions regarding the CMM on crew labour standards, co-chaired by Indonesia and New Zealand. It noted that although the discussions remain in progress, it was of utmost importance to finalize and adopt the proposal to avoid and mitigate the risks of further abuse to crew members perpetrated by captains and vessel owners that operate in the WCPFC Convention Area (WCPFC-CA). Indonesia also reiterated the provision in Article 4 of the WCPFC Convention that nothing in the Convention shall prejudice the rights, jurisdiction, and duties of States under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), and that the Convention should be interpreted and applied in the context of and in a manner consistent with these international agreements. In concluding Indonesia stated its hope that the deliberations at WCPFC18 would provide beneficial results that contribute significantly to joint efforts to meet the WCPFC’s objectives, and underlined its willingness to work constructively and cooperatively with other delegations during WCPC18."
WCPFC18,16,"Niue, on behalf of the South Pacific Group (SPG) stated it is an informal group of SIDS who share strong interests in the sustainable development of the southern longline fisheries for southern albacore, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  5    swordfish, bigeye and yellowfin. The SPG includes Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. The SPG stated that longline provisions of the tropical tuna CMM must recognise the sovereign rights of coastal States to manage fishing activity within their EEZs, in accordance with the provisions of the WCPF Convention and UNCLOS. The SPG stated that any vessel fishing in their waters should be managed under their management framework, including any applicable limits, in the same manner that any catch taken in waters under national jurisdiction is attributed to the coastal State. SPG members stated they prioritise the development by the WCPFC of zone-based management for all longline fisheries, and look forward to working with other members in developing sustainable and equitable limits that respect rights for the high seas and coastal State sovereign rights for EEZs.  They strongly supported the retention of paragraph 44 of the current CMM, including the amendments proposed by FFA, and advocated that WCPFC19 in 2022 determine hard high seas limits for bigeye in 2022, and apply those limits to CCMs in a manner that is consistent with their sovereign rights, and Articles 8, 10 (3) and 30 of the Convention. SPG members expressed their deep concerned at the continuing decline of South Pacific albacore fisheries and the impact on their fisheries-dependent economies. They noted that southern fisheries interact with the tropical longline fisheries, and are impacted by changes in tropical longline management, fishing activities and catches. Consequently, they stated that they believe it is critical to avoid any increase in longline fishing effort, or increase in bigeye limits. SPG members stated that any such increase, particularly south of the equator, would result in additional catches of albacore, resulting in a disproportionate burden on SPG members, and that such increases may also result in fleet behavioural changes that could negatively impact their southern longline fisheries. SPG members advocated that the tropical tuna CMM not allow for any overall increase in longline fishing effort, or any overall increase in bigeye limits, and noted that any proposal to increase tropical longline fishing effort, or an overall increase in bigeye limits, must consider the impact on SIDS as per CMM 2013-06. They noted that this obviously includes other territories outside the FFA group, and recognised the development aspirations and concerns of those territories. SPG members stated they would be seeking further study on the interactions and impacts of longline fishing effort on their southern longline fisheries, and called for an immediate freeze on albacore catch from the high seas."
WCPFC18,17,"The Philippines expressed it appreciation to the Secretariat for making the WCPFC18 meeting arrangements amid the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to CCMs located in different time zones for their flexibility and sustained participation, while acknowledging the difficulties they face. The Philippines also expressed appreciation for the support of the Commission through the West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Project for technical assistance to enhance its capacity in providing the data to address WCPFC17’s recommendations on paragraph 51 (Other Commercial Fisheries) of CMM 2020-01. It stated that it continues to make progress in complying with the CMM through enhanced implementing regulations and was confident it would be able to address outstanding issues. It stated its commitment to engaging positively with all CCMs, to listening and understanding their concerns, and to presenting its views and concerns for the formulation of an inclusive and robust tropical tuna measure. The Philippines also solicited support from the Commission for its efforts to strengthen control of Philippine-flagged vessels through its upgraded vessel monitoring system (VMS), which would enable it to fulfil its obligations as a responsible flag state. It expressed its commitment to working with the Commission towards this end. The Philippines also thanked the Secretariat for its assistance to the Philippines and other CCMs for their collective effort to progress the objectives of the Commission in the sustainable utilization of the straddling and highly migratory fish stocks in the WCPO, particularly tropical tunas, which are critically important to the overall economy of the Philippines, especially in providing food and livelihood to millions of Filipinos."
WCPFC18,18,"Tuvalu expressed its support for the Chair, ably supported by the WCPFC Executive Director and his team, and extended greetings to the Ministers, officials, secretariats and all participants in WCPFC18. It noted that while Tuvalu’s officials have worked through a long series of video-conferences, it is often difficult to reach agreement on complex issues in this way, and expressed the hope that CCMs could make substantive progress during WCPFC18, while noting the need to ensure that strong management measures were in place at the end of the meeting, even if agreement could not be reached on all the desired changes. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  6    Tuvalu stated that the tropical tuna CMM is the key issue at WCPFC18 meeting for Tuvalu, stating that these stocks, and the economic benefits that derive from them, are vital for the future well-being of the country and its people. It stated that the current measure served the Commission well, and continues to ensure that the main tuna stocks are harvested sustainably. Tuvalu stated that it approached the discussions asking ‘why change something that is working well?’ However, it stated it also recognized that members all have their own interests, and some feel that the current measures are too precautionary, or are not to the advantage of their national fleets. Tuvalu urged CCMs to exercise restraint in seeking changes to the current well-balanced package of measures, and stated that if changes were made they needed to reflect the balance between fisheries and the interests of members, particularly respecting the legitimate aspirations of SIDS. Tuvalu noted the extensive discussions that had been held between CCMs regarding the objectives for the new CMM. It noted that while this was understandable – setting objectives is normally the first step in a plan of action –for reasons well known to CCMs it was difficult to reach agreement. It noted that the new tropical tuna measure remained a bridging measure while important work on harvest strategies continued, and urged members to leave aside differences on objectives and ensure a CMM is passed that ensures stocks are sustainable. Tuvalu stated that it was optimistic that agreement on a new tropical tuna measure would be reached, but that there were many differences in national positions, and advocated that if agreement could not be reached, the Commission should revert to what had been agreed in the past and retain the current CMM. In view of the time and effort already been invested in the process, Tuvalu stated it did not want to repeat the process again in 2022, and advocated any CMM should be adopted for a further 3 years, to allow substantive progress on harvest strategies. 1.3 Meeting Arrangements"
WCPFC18,19,"The Commission reviewed the meeting arrangements and indicative meeting schedule, and confirmed decisions made at the Heads of Delegation meeting, held on 28 November, including affirming the meeting schedule, as announced in Circular 2021/99 of 12 November 2021."
WCPFC18,20,"The EU acknowledged the efforts made by the Chair and the Secretariat in arranging the meeting agenda and the schedule. The EU noted that since the beginning of the pandemic it has advocated that meeting schedules be set so as to share the burden among all CCMs, noting that this was being done by other regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs). The EU stated that unfortunately in the WCPFC the concept of balanced meeting schedules had not been adopted, which resulted in the inability of the EU to participate in several intersessional meetings. It stated that it had proposed several options to share the burden, which would mean that one or two sessions would extend beyond the working hours of the Secretariat, but that this had been opposed by some CCMs. The EU recognized the effort to alleviate its concerns through the inclusion of break days, and stated it would participate in the meeting in a constructive spirit. It closed by reiterating its thanks to the Chair for her efforts to develop the schedule under such difficult circumstances.   1.3.1 Online meeting protocols"
WCPFC18,21,"The Secretariat’s IT Manager, Mr. Tim Jones, explained the key online meeting protocols.    1.3.2  Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMR, others)"
WCPFC18,22,"The Commission agreed to establish three SWGs: (i) a CNM SWG, chaired by the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC) vice-chair Ms. Emily Crigler (USA); a Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) SWG, chaired by the TCC Chair, Mr. Mat Kertesz; and a List of Obligations SWG to consider the obligations to be addressed under the CMS in 2022, chaired by Ms. Heather Ward (New Zealand). WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  7"
WCPFC18,23,"China supported the establishment of the SWGs, while noting that with respect to the List of Obligations SWG, because the Commission did not adopt any new measures in 2021 the list should remain unchanged from that considered in 2021.  AGENDA ITEM 2   — ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC18,24,"The Executive Director’s Annual Report (WCPFC18-2021-04), which is a requirement under Rule 13 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure, was issued on October 18, and was taken as read. The paper was posted on the WCPFC18 ODF (as Topic A); and the Executive Director confirmed no comments were exchanged on the ODF."
WCPFC18,25,"PNG thanked the Executive Director for the report and for the work described in it. It asked for clarification on the status of the IT system upgrade and what further work is planned, as well as additional information regarding the work on streamlined reporting and the ability of the system to accommodate additional reporting as may be required under new or revised CMMs. The Finance and Administration Manager, Mr. Aaron Nighswander, stated the Secretariat would be updating IT systems as it transitions to a new platform with additional capabilities, and would provide more detail as those updates proceeded. The Compliance Manager, Dr. Lara Manarangi-Trott, noted that the systems upgrade is described in the latter part of the Executive Director’s report; the work underway was described in some detailed during TCC17, and in WCPFC18-2021-IP12, which reports against the forecast the Secretariat has made with respect to the work that may be tasked to the Secretariat as a result of WCPFC18 decisions. She noted that much of that is driven by the TCC work program and the CMS. She stated that the IT Manger has led the team of consultants undertaking the IT work and has begun migration of the CCFS, which should be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2022. The Commission’s existing ER system is used for high seas transhipment reporting and remains operational; no disruptions are expected. She stated that some work remains to be done regarding the Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV), which is scheduled to be undertaken following completion of the CCFS work, and that the Secretariat would look at the system for CCMs’ Annual Reports following confirmation of any enhancements to be undertaken under the CMS. She stated that a number of papers presented to TCC outlined the expectations, and as the Secretariat reported to FAC, progress remained largely on track. The IT Manager added that from a capacity perspective most of the Commission’s external facing sites are cloud-based, and thus housed in an environment that can be readily scaled up if more resources are needed."
WCPFC18,26,The Commission adopted the 2021 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC18-2021-04).   AGENDA ITEM 3  —  MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 3.1 Status of the Convention
WCPFC18,27,"New Zealand’s report as the Depositary on the status of the WCPF Convention (WCPFC18-2021-05 Status of the Convention) was taken as read. The Executive Director confirmed that the paper was included in the WWCPFC18 ODF as Topic E, but no comments were received."
WCPFC18,28,The Commission noted with appreciation the report on the Status of the WCPF Convention (WCPFC18-2021-05).  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  8    3.2 Update on Observer Status
WCPFC18,29,"The Chair noted with appreciation the contributions of the accredited observers to the work of the Commission. The Secretariat’s updated report on observer status (WCPFC18-2021-06 List of Observers) was taken as read; it notes that no state or NGO observers were removed in 2021 under the requirements of Rule 36 of the Rules of Procedure. The Executive Director confirmed that the paper was included in the WCPFC18 ODF as Topic D, but no comments were received."
WCPFC18,30,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC18-2021-06).   3.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status
WCPFC18,31,"The Commission considered applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status for 2022 in accordance with CMM 2019-01, including recommendations from TCC17. The Chair noted that as outlined in WCPFC18-2021-07: Cooperating Non-Member Requests for 2022_rev2, there were eight applications for CNM status in 2022 from the Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam. All applicants for 2022 were CNMs in 2021; of the 2021 CNMs, only the Bahamas did not apply for CNM status in 2022, but the Bahamas remained a CNM until the end of 2021."
WCPFC18,32,"The Assistant Compliance Manager stated that all CNMs had made the required payments for 2021, and that of the 8 applicants, 7 were currently attending; all were registered but Liberia had yet to join the meeting. The TCC Vice-Chair and Chair of CNM SWG stated that there had been two requests for additional information made by TCC to CNMs (one to Liberia and one to Nicaragua), and that the requested information had been received."
WCPFC18,33,"The Commission noted and accepted the 8 applications for CNM status in 2022 from Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam. The Commission agreed that the CNM SWG would meet to work on CNM participatory rights, and that applicants could attend the SWG to provide clarifications and answers to questions that might be posed. Following its deliberations, the SWG would provide advice to the Commission on the participatory rights of CNMs (under Agenda Item 3.3.1)."
WCPFC18,34,"The Commission approved the applications for CNM status for 2022 from Curaçao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam.  3.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs"
WCPFC18,35,The Commission reviewed the limits of participatory rights of CNMs under various CMMs in accordance with paragraphs 12 and 13 of CMM 2019-01.
WCPFC18,36,"The Commission agreed to the following limits to be applied to the participatory rights of CNMs per the Convention and CMM 2019-01: i. In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  ii. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  9    iii. CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV).  iv. CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  v. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the Secretariat for attention by TCC.  Participatory rights of each CNM in 2022"
WCPFC18,37,"The Commission considered the findings of the CNM SWG, which recommended that Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam retain the same participatory rights in 2022 as they had in 2021. The CNM SWG also noted that in both 2020 and 2021, Nicaragua requested that the CNM SWG and the Commission consider revising their participatory rights to increase purse seine fishing from one to two vessels. Nicaragua indicated that the addition of one vessel would greatly assist in allowing the timely submission of financial contributions and further enhance their ability to implement WCPFC CMMs in the WCPFC-CA. CNM SWG participants were unable to support the requested addition to Nicaragua’s participatory rights for 2022 due to the existing purse seine capacity limits as stipulated in paragraph 45 of the current tropical tuna measure (CMM 2020-01/2018-01). However, to assist the Commission with considering any increased participatory rights in the future, the CNM SWG invited Nicaragua to put forward any proposed changes to participatory rights when submitting their CNM application in future years, to allow TCC to properly consider the implications of such a request prior to the Commission’s annual meeting."
WCPFC18,38,Curaçao: The participatory rights of Curacao are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.
WCPFC18,39,"Ecuador: The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2020-01 or its replacement measure."
WCPFC18,40,El Salvador: The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2020-01 or its replacement measure.
WCPFC18,41,Liberia: The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.

WCPFC18,46,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and 50˚S between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Nicaragua and Panama will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area."
WCPFC18,47,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC18,48,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.   AGENDA ITEM 4  — NEW PROPOSALS   Tropical Tuna CMM"
WCPFC18,49,"The Chair’s introduction, CCMs’ introductory statements, and the Commission’s further deliberations on the Chair Consultative draft on a new tropical tuna CMM are addressed under Agenda Item 7.2.2.  Revisions to the CMM for sharks (WCPFC18-2021-DP01)"
WCPFC18,50,"The USA introduced its proposed revisions to the CMM for Sharks (CMM 2019-04) as detailed in WCPFC18-2021-DP01 Proposed Revisions to the Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks. (Agenda Item 4). The USA stated that the current WCPFC shark measure, CMM 2019-04, includes a number of provisions applicable generally for shark conservation and management, and specifically to stocks of concern. Two of the stocks included are the oceanic whitetip shark, which is experiencing overfishing and is overfished, and the silky shark, which is experiencing overfishing. The USA stated that the Commission has prohibited retention of both of these species, but further action is needed to rebuild these stocks, noting that SC17 reviewed analysis conducted under WCPFC Project 101 that indicated that: WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  11    a prohibiting shark lines could reduce fishing mortality for oceanic whitetip sharks by 5.4% and for silky sharks by 2.6%, and  b prohibiting wire trace as branchlines could reduce fishing mortality of oceanic whitetip sharks by about 36%, and of silky sharks by about 28%.   That analysis further indicated that prohibiting both shark lines and wire trace as branchlines had the potential to reduce fishing mortality by approximately 40% for oceanic whitetip sharks and 31% for silky sharks.  The USA stated it is important for the Commission to act to enhance protections for sharks generally, and that the proposed prohibitions would have a significant benefit for silky shark and oceanic whitetip shark stocks. The USA stated its proposal modifies paragraph 14 to prohibit both the use of wire trace as branch lines and the use of shark lines, and deletes paragraph 15 requiring CCMs to notify the Commission as to which option (wire trace or shark lines) is prohibited on a vessel by vessel or fleet basis. The current shark CMM only requires CCMs to prohibit the use of wire trace as branch lines or the use of shark lines. The proposal also modifies the implementation deadline to January 2023, and removes a footnote, which delayed implementation of the measure until 2021."
WCPFC18,51,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the USA for this proposal and the completed 2013-06 assessment, stating that they appreciated this and considered it a good example of an assessment under CMM 2013-06. FFA members noted that this is an important issue for them, and that the use of wire traces and shark lines by longline vessels operating within FFA members’ waters is already prohibited through FFA’s Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions. They supported the proposal from the USA."
WCPFC18,52,"Canada supported the proposal, noting its concern about the status of sharks globally, and stated that it agreed that the measures outlined would help restore populations of these shark species in the WCPO."
WCPFC18,53,"The EU noted its interest in ideas and proposals that reduce the impact on species caught in association with WCPFC fisheries. It noted that silky and oceanic whitetip sharks were already protected through a non-retention ban, and stated this appeared to be having a positive impact in terms of reduced mortality, especially in the case of silky sharks. The EU stated that exploring mitigation measures was central to the conservation of bycatch species, and that a study presented to TCC17 showed that the adoption of wire leaders would reduce bycatch and mortality, but as noted by several CCMs at TCC17 much work remained to be done. The EU stressed that past experience has shown that mitigation measures can yield different results depending on the fishery and species in question, and referenced a study in the Indian ocean that suggested that use of monofilament could increase bycatch of silky sharks. The EU also stated that mitigation measures may have differing impacts depending on the situation. It stated that it understood the intent, but that the proposal should take into account a number of relevant considerations (such as the species distribution, and interaction rates by gear, area, and season). Noting that SC17 requested further analysis that should be reviewed at SC18, the EU suggested further analysis might allow SC to develop recommendations on specific mitigation measures that could reduce mortality for these species. It looked forward to considering specific recommendations from SC18 on this issue."
WCPFC18,54,"China stated its view was similar to that of the EU, noting the preliminary nature of the information, and stated it would welcome consideration of the issue after receiving specific recommendations from SC. It stated it was unable to support implementation of the proposed recommendations at WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,55,"Japan also agreed on the lack of clear scientific evidence to impose the proposed measure, and called for further study."
WCPFC18,56,Chinese Taipei agreed on the need for additional study.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  12
WCPFC18,57,"FSM on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau supported the USA proposal to ban wire traces and shark lines in longline fisheries. They stated that they expect that removal of both wire traces and shark lines would be very effective at reducing shark mortality, noting that PNA members and Tokelau have a number of domestic laws banning both wire traces and shark lines, and that some members have gone further by banning targeted shark fishing and implementing shark sanctuaries."
WCPFC18,58,"WWF, Pew, and The Ocean Foundation thanked the USA for conducting the scientific study, submitting the proposal, and in particular noted the support that was provided by the Hawaii longline fleet in the study. They noted that the work was built on previous work by Harley et al and constitutes the best available scientific evidence as established under the WCPF Convention. They stated it has been put before SC twice and as such been fully vetted and subject to peer review. They noted that as FFA and the PNA stated, the measure is already in place across most of the WCPFC region through the FFA’s Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions. They stated that if a simple change in gear to mitigate shark mortality is unacceptable, the Commission has no choice but to consider reducing longline effort in areas with greater interactions with oceanic whitetip, as WCPFC has a responsibility to rebuild depleted species such as oceanic whitetip, and appropriately manage species caught in association with fishing."
WCPFC18,59,"The USA stated it would continue discussions in 2022 through TCC and SC, and hoped to submit a new proposal to WCPFC19. Amendment to the Charter Notification CMM (WCPFC18-2021-DP02)"
WCPFC18,60,"Japan introduced its proposed amendment to CMM 2019-08: WCPFC18-2021-DP02. Proposed amendment to the current CMM 2019-08 for Charter Notification Scheme, noting that CMM 2019-08 will expire on 28 February 2022 unless renewed by the Commission. It stated that this CMM is critical for the Commission as it clarifies the attribution of catch and efforts of chartered vessels, and enables the compiling of fundamental catch and effort data for each CCM. In this context, Japan proposed the extension of the CMM, with two amendments. To ensure that the information of charter notifications is transmitted to the SSP (SPC) in a timely manner, so that the SSP can compile catch and effort data for each CCM accurately, Japan proposed amendments to paragraphs 2 and 3, so that charter information is transmitted to the SSP at the same time as to flag States and the Secretariat. In addition, to compile catch and effort data accurately, Japan propose amending paragraph 2 to add “the area of application” to the list of information to be notified."
WCPFC18,61,"In the ensuing discussion CCMs noted the importance of the Charter Notification CMM, including for compiling accurate catch and effort data, and to support the domestic development (and the special requirements) of SIDS CCMs, and supported the extension of the CMM. The value of the additional reporting specifications proposed by Japan was also noted.  Proposal to amend CMM 2019-08 Charter Notification Scheme (WCPFC18-2021-DP02_rev1 - Japan)"
WCPFC18,62,The Commission adopted CMM 2021-04 Conservation and Management Measure on Charter Notification Scheme (Attachment E)  IUU Vessel Cross-Listing (WCPFC18-2021-DP03)
WCPFC18,63,"The EU introduced a joint proposal by Canada, the EU, Japan and Chinese Taipei for amending CMM 2019-07 regarding the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, as detailed in WCPFC18-2021-DP03-rev2 Proposal for amending CMM 2019-07 (WCPFC IUU Vessel List. The EU stated that inputs from sponsors, the Secretariat, the Legal Adviser and other CCMs had allowed significant improvements. In light of WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  13    comments received and to further reduce the risk of additional workload and administrative burden for SIDS and the Secretariat, it stated that the proposal limits the cross listing to only tuna RFMOs and RFMOs with competences in the Pacific. Additionally, for the same reason, the procedure for the automatic delisting was limited to only once in the year, at the same time as the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. It also clarified that the Secretariat and CCMs will not need to review the information that led to the original listing of the vessels when considering the cross listing of vessel listed by other RFMOs. It noted that this would create a single tool for the members of WCPFC to identify if a vessel operating within the WCPFC-CA is currently listed in any of the cross-listed RFMO IUU list, thereby significantly reducing the time required for screening all IUU lists of each RFMO before (for example) granting port access to a particular fishing vessel. It advocated that the proposed revision to the CMM could contribute to effectively reducing workloads, especially for small administrations."
WCPFC18,64,This issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 11. Proposals by the Northern Committee
WCPFC18,65,"The NC Chair, Mr. Masanori Miyahara (Japan) noted with appreciation to the Secretariat the reference paper WCPFC18-2021-19 Reference Document for the review of CMM 2019-02 and development of harvest strategies (Pacific Bluefin Tuna) and Highlights from NC17 for Agenda 9.3, which was prepared by the Secretariat and presents two NC proposals before WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,66,"The NC Chair stated detailed explanation would be deferred to Agenda Item 7.4 for the proposed revision to CMM 2019-02 for Pacific bluefin tuna, and to agenda Item 9.3 for the Harvest Strategy alteration for Pacific bluefin tuna. Best Handling Practices for Marine Mammals"
WCPFC18,67,"The TCC Chair introduced the guidelines contained in WCPFC18-2021-26 for best handling practices of marine mammals, specifically cetaceans, for purse seine and longline vessels fishing for tuna and tuna-like species in the WCPO. The TCC Chair stated that SC17 considered a paper prepared by the United States presenting draft Best Practices for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans. The best practices were subsequently considered in detail by both the SC and TCC. SC17 recommended that the draft best handling practices be forwarded to TCC17 and WCPFC18 for consideration, and that the Commission develop graphics to be included with the best handling practices for consideration at WCPFC19. TCC17 in turn endorsed the Best Practices for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans (TCC17-2021-23) pending revisions suggested by a CCM at TCC17, and noted that a revised version of the best practices would be submitted to WCPFC18 for its review and endorsement. The Secretariat, in consultation with the TCC Chair and TCC-Vice Chair, prepared the guidelines presented in WCPFC18-2021-26 for review and consideration by WCPFC18. The amendments suggested at TCC17 were agreed in principle by TCC17 and were fully incorporated; they can be seen in track changes in attachment A to WCPFC18-2021-26."
WCPFC18,68,This issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 9.2.  AGENDA ITEM 5  — INTERSESSIONAL DECISIONS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19
WCPFC18,69,"The Chair noted that the Secretariat’s discussion paper WCPFC18-2021-08 COVID-19 Related Intersessional Decisions was taken as read, and reflected the outcomes and discussion at TCC17. The paper was posted on the WCPFC18 ODF as Topic B, and no comments were received. In the TCC17 Summary Report, TCC17 recommended:  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  14    • that WCPFC18 continue the suspensions of the three intersessional decisions after 15 December until 15 March 2022; and  • that the Commission review through an expedited inter-sessional decision-making process, the possible phasing in of the removal of the suspensions, which would need to be implemented flexibly and be subject to a periodic review in light of changed circumstances."
WCPFC18,70,"The EU observed that COVID-19 situation had worsened since TCC17, and that it was less confident now regarding the full redeployment of observers in 2022. It stated that creative thinking was needed on how to proceed, as the lack of observers was impacting both scientific advice and compliance monitoring. It noted that WCPFC18-2021-08 indicates there are increased unobserved activities (e.g., only 70% of transhipments were observed). The EU stated that there is little information regarding additional MCS measures that CCMs have put in place, and suggested that a requirement be added to any new intersessional decision that CCMs using derogations indicate in their Annual Reports any additional MCS measures that they apply. The EU suggested that this could be used by TCC18 to assess the monitoring of the impact of COVID-19, and shape future decisions if the pandemic continues."
WCPFC18,71,"PNG, on behalf of FFA members, supported the TCC17 recommendations to WCPFC18 to continue the suspensions of the three intersessional decisions until 15 March 2022, and further recommended that WCPFC18 lift the suspension of the obligation relating to at sea transhipment by purse vessels (thereby reinstating this obligation) as of 15 March 2022, as part of a phased-in approach to lifting the suspensions. FFA members encouraged CCMs to use the FFA COVID-19 Operating Protocols for the Fishing Sector in the Pacific, which were shared with CCMs prior to TCC16 and updated in April 2021, and to prioritise the vaccination of fishing vessel crew, as two key requirements to re-commence deployment of observers on fishing vessels. FFA members highlighted that, notwithstanding the temporary suspension of observer coverage requirements and noting that the suspension does not prevent the placement of observers on fishing vessels, few FFA members were able to deploy observers on fishing vessels during the COVID-19 pandemic. FFA members encouraged CCMs that are able to start redeploying observers on their vessels, and to work with observer providers to operationalise the Protocols in order to enable observers to be safely placed on fishing vessels."
WCPFC18,72,The Commission noted the paper on COVID-19 related Intersessional Decisions prepared by the Secretariat (WCPFC18-2021-08).
WCPFC18,73,The Commission agreed to continue the suspensions of the three intersessional decisions after 15 December until 15 March 2022.
WCPFC18,74,"The Commission agreed to review through an expedited inter-sessional decision-making process, the possible phasing in of the removal of the suspensions, which would need to be implemented flexibly and be subject to a periodic review in light of changed circumstances."
WCPFC18,75,"The Commission encouraged CCMs to provide additional information on their implementation of the Intersessional Decisions taken in response to COVID-19, including of additional MCS measures implemented, through their Annual Report Part 2 reporting or via circular.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  15    AGENDA ITEM 6  — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES  6.1 Implementation of Article 30 of WCPFC Convention and CMM 2013-07 (SIDS special requirements)"
WCPFC18,76,"The Chair noted that para. 20 of CMM 2013-07 requires an annual review of implementation of this measure, and referenced WCPFC18-2021-IP01 Summary from Part 2 CMM 2013-07 paragraph 19 annual reports (WCPFC-TCC16-2020-11_rev1)."
WCPFC18,77,The Executive Director stated that there were no issues related to Agenda item 6.1 raised in the ODF.
WCPFC18,78,"RMI on behalf of FFA members stated that the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS is the cornerstone of fisheries governance in the region. FFA members stated that Article 30 is the “foundation” upon which the Convention is built, which underscores the importance that FFA members attach to the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS. To appreciate the significance of this agenda item to SIDS, they noted that the map of the region shows States have the responsibility to manage fisheries over vast areas of ocean, in addition to their development aspirations. FFA members noted they have introduced initiatives such as CMM 2013-06 (the criteria to be applied when considering proposals for measures) and CMM 2013-07 (overarching principles in support of the full recognition of SIDS special requirements). To improve the implementation of CMM 2013-06 FFA members have repeatedly called for accurate and complete assessments on the impacts of proposals that take into account the views of SIDS, and indicated that an assessment that is inaccurate and incomplete will not comply with the binding requirements in that measure. From 2022 FFA members stated they would not entertain any proposal that does not have a CMM 13-06 assessment that was developed in consultation with them. FFA members noted that CMM 2013-07 is also an important binding measure, which provides principles that also take into account provisions in the UNFSA. FFA members invited other CCMs to also note the principles in that measure relating to allocation as they support SIDS’ domestic development aspirations. FFA members stated that Article 30 of the Convention (as well as articles 24–26 of the UNFSA), CMM 2013-06, and CMM 2013-07 provide a robust framework for the full recognition of SIDS’ special requirements. FFA members stated that it was up to them to determine what their special requirements are, and to determine their domestic development aspirations. They called on developed CCMs to provide targeted assistance that is aligned with SIDS’ domestic development aspirations and special requirements, and thanked CCMs and the Commission for the assistance rendered to SIDS. FFA members also reiterated that Article 30 of the Convention and the various binding measures referred to earlier are fundamental and must be taken into consideration at every aspect of the work of the Commission. FFA members stated they continue to stress the importance of a 2013-06 assessment of any proposed measure, in close consultation with SIDS, to ensure that it does not result in transferring, directly or indirectly, any disproportionate burden of conservation and management action onto SIDS and territories. In addition, they stated that there is a need to ensure effective participation of SIDS in the work of the Commission, by ensuring there are no barriers to engagement such as meeting outside business hours of the Secretariat. They thanked the Chair for taking this into account in the schedule of WCPFC18. They stressed that the most important issue is ensuring opportunities for SIDS participation in the fishery, now and in the future, and that the negotiation of the tropical tuna CMM, and any other measure, must take this into account, especially given that the WCPO is largely made up of the EEZs of Pacific Island SIDS. They stated that any proposal that will hinder SIDS’ participation in the fisheries is in direct contravention of Article 30 of the Convention. FFA members also noted that the Commission’s annual budget has increased over time, as have the financial obligations of CCMs through the assessed contributions. As noted in past meetings, FFA members stated they are concerned with the increasing trend in the budget and the assessed contributions and reiterated that concern. They stated they fully recognize the importance of both the science and compliance aspects of the budget as an integral part of managing and conserving the fisheries resources, but stated that the Commission needs to seriously reconsider options for WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  16    a sustainable Commission budget. FFA members also thanked the Secretariat for the Updated Strategic Plan as it aims to match capacity and capability requirements of developing states and territories with appropriate investment strategies. Related to this, they thanked the contributors to the various funds which SIDS directly benefit from, in particular, the Special Requirements Fund, the Japan Trust Fund, and the Chinese Taipei Trust Fund."
WCPFC18,79,Samoa aligned itself with the statement provided by RMI and FFA members.
WCPFC18,80,WCPFC18 continued to recognise the importance of assessing the impact of proposals on SIDS in accordance with CMM 2013-06.  6.2 Updated Strategic Investment Plan
WCPFC18,81,"The Updated Strategic Investment Plan (WCPFC18-2020-09) was posted on the WCPFC18 ODF (as Topic C), and no comments were received. The Chair noted that the specific purpose of the plan is to match capacity needs and requirements of developing states and territories with appropriate investment strategies."
WCPFC18,82,"The EU reiterated its commitment to a healthy Pacific Ocean and strong and healthy marine resources. It stated that most of the needs identified can be addressed through the EU’s flagship cooperation program — The Pacific-European Union Marine Partnership —which is being implemented by regional organisations, including FFA, SPC, South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and the University of the South Pacific. The EU stated that WCPFC18-2021-DP06 includes details on the partnership, including activities undertaken from July 2020 to July 2021, and the website contains a full overview of the program since its inception. €1,000,000 has been earmarked to assist FFA members to comply with WCPFC requirements, although no activities have yet been implemented because of COVID-19 restrictions. The EU encouraged FFA members and the WCPFC Secretariat to work together and develop creative ways to use these funds to the benefit of FFA members and CCMs at large."
WCPFC18,83,"Japan stated it fully recognizes the importance of the criteria in CMM 2013-06, and that when submitting a proposal, it carefully looks at the checklist contained in the CMM, and would continue to do so in the future. In this regard, it stated its complete agreement with FFA members that CMM 2013-06 can be effectively addressed by consulting with SIDS, either individually or through FFA. Japan stated it was unfortunate it could not have a physical meeting with FFA and PNA members in 2021 due to COVID-19, but noted it had several virtual consultations with them that were quite useful. Japan stated its strong hope to be able to visit Honiara and Majuro to meet in person in 2022. Japan stated it has been providing SIDS with assistance for infrastructure and capacity building through JICA and OFCF. During 2010 to 2019 Japan provided about ¥200 billion in development assistance to the Pacific islands, which includes fishery-related projects. Fishery-related projects cover conservation and management of highly migratory species and assistance to small-scale fishermen. At the Ninth Pacific Leaders Meeting held virtually in July 2021, Japan announced its commitment to the continuation of its robust development assistance and more than 5,500 people-to-people exchanges and human resource development for the next three years. In 2008 Japan established Japan Trust Fund within WCPFC, which has been assisting capacity building of SIDS for fishery statistics and fishery management. A call for proposals was sent to CCMs on November 15 through Circular No 2021/100. Japan stated its hope that SIDS members would actively consider their applications by the deadline of December 22nd. In addition, Japan has been supporting SIDS since 2008 through the Japan Promotion Fund via OFCF. SIDS can utilize this Fund for various purposes such as enhancement of management capacity. In November 2017, in response to the strong request from SIDS, OFCF signed with FFA to renew the term for another ten years until 2027. Also, in 2020, OFCF increased the size of the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  17    Promotion Fund. Japan stated its sincere hope that these programs and funds would contribute to fishery development of SIDS."
WCPFC18,84,The Commission noted with appreciation the update provided by the Secretariat on implementation of the Strategic Investment Plan (WCPFC18-2021-09).
WCPFC18,85,The Commission approved the updated 2021 Strategic Investment Plan (Attachment F).   AGENDA ITEM 7  — WCPO TUNA AND BILLFISH STOCKS  7.1  General overview of status of WCPO stocks
WCPFC18,86,"Dr. John Hampton (SPC) presented an overview of the stock status of bigeye, skipjack, South Pacific albacore and yellowfin tuna, including an update on recent events in the fisheries focusing on longline and purse seine activity, and a summary of the stock status of the major species. As references he noted WCPFC18-2021-IP02_rev1 The Western and Central Pacific Tuna Fishery:2020 Overview and Status of Stocks and the WCPFC Tuna Fishery Yearbook 2020."
WCPFC18,87,"The 2020 total catch of about 2.74 million mt was about average for the last decade; the 2020 purse seine catch of 1.88 million mt was also about average, while the longline catch of 217,000 mt was the lowest since 1996 (this figure may increase as more data become available). In the purse seine fishery total catch is dominated by skipjack, and catch has been at a similar level for a decade. Effort has decreased in terms of total fishing days, but has been stable over 6-7 years since a decline from the 2012-2013 level. Purse seine fishing days as measured by VMS indicates 2021 is above average but within the range of the last decade. Regarding purse seine set types, the number of FAD-associated sets has been fairly stable over the past decade; following a large increase in the 2010s the number of unassociated sets has been stable. The total catch by set type is almost equally split between free school and associated sets. The tropical purse seine catch per unit effort (CPUE) has been fairly stable over time, with the average trending up slightly over the last decade; CPUE is generally robust, showing a decline prior to the FAD closure (in 2021). The total longline catch is fairly stable, with a possible slight contraction in the last 15 years. Total longline effort has declined considerably since 2012, stable since then. Examination of VMS longline fishing days for 2021 indicates effort is above average, but within the range of the last 10 years. The tropical longline fishery (20°N–10°S) targets bigeye and yellowfin: reported effort and reported catches of both species are down in 2020, but CPUE was stable in 2020 and over the past decade. In the southern longline fishery, there has been no substantial decline in effort, which is similar to historic highs, and catch has also been maintained at fairly high level, while CPUE is down somewhat. In terms of stock status all stocks are in good condition and WCPO remains only region where all main tuna stocks neither overfished or experiencing overfishing. Regarding spawning biomass depletion, most recent estimates are above the LRP (20% SB/SBF=0) for all four main stocks. Projections (30 year) of SB depletion (which use recent levels of catch and effort) show increasing uncertainty over time because of recruitment uncertainty, but generally remain above the LRP.  The exception was South Pacific albacore, where the risk of falling below the LRP was influenced by a large recruitment uncertainty, which is related to uncertainties associated with the stock assessment. With regard to other species, some are overfished and/or subject to overfishing (Southwest Pacific striped marlin is likely overfished; North Pacific striped marlin, Oceanic Whitetip shark and Pacific bluefin are overfished and subject to overfishing; and Pacific silky shark is not overfished, but is subject to overfishing.) The status of Pacific bigeye thresher shark is inconclusive. The outlook for the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is that fairly strong La Niña conditions will continue for 3-4 months, gradually shifting to neutral ENSO conditions by mid-2022.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  18"
WCPFC18,88,"Kiribati on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau noted that the report indicates the tropical tuna stocks are healthy, and the major tropical fisheries are stable, but that the picture on the other stocks is not so positive. They noted that a single table was shown covering all the shark, billfish, and northern stocks, which was very informative, but not included in the paper. They inquired whether there was reason for that, and if not, could it be included in the paper in future. They also noted the Kobe plot on page 51 for five of those stocks, and inquired whether a Kobe plot could be provided for more of the other stocks? SPC replied that their ability to prepare a Kobe plot for other stocks would depend on the provision of information in the relevant stock assessments, and how uncertainty is expressed, but that this could be considered for future presentations if required."
WCPFC18,89,"The Commission noted the stock status of bigeye, yellowfin, skipjack and South Pacific albacore as presented by the Scientific Services Provider (SPC).  7.2 Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin"
WCPFC18,90,"The Chair noted three issues would be addressed under Agenda Item 7.2: harvest strategy issues, the new tropical tuna measure, and the issue of ‘Other Commercial Fisheries’, which is also relevant to the new tropical tuna CMM. The Chair noted the reference document prepared by the Secretariat: WCPFC18-2021-14. Reference document for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna for the review of CMM 2020-01 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06. 7.2.1 Harvest Strategy Issues"
WCPFC18,91,"The Chair noted WCPFC18-2021-WP12 by SPC. Recent progress in the technical development of harvest strategies for WCPFC stocks and fisheries (previously presented to SC17 as SC17-MI-WP-03), and observed that the harvest strategy issues would also have bearing on the tropical tuna measure discussions. The Chair noted that the Indicative Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06, as updated in December 2020, anticipates the Commission would consider at WCPFC18 the advice and information from SC17 and SPC on possible formulations of a TRP for skipjack as well as bigeye and yellowfin, including the results of further analysis requested by SC17 related to the impact of candidate bigeye and yellowfin TRPs on the South Pacific albacore stock. 7.2.1.1 Review of target reference point for skipjack"
WCPFC18,92,"Dr. Graham Pilling (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-10 by SPC. Further updates to WCPO skipjack tuna projected stock status to inform consideration of an updated target reference point. The WCPO skipjack tuna assessment agreed to in 2019 incorporated new information on stock biology (e.g., the pattern of maturity-at-length), a new spatial structure, and new model settings. In a similar way to the assessment of WCPO bigeye tuna performed in 2017, this changed the perception of stock status and its productivity compared to the model upon which the decisions on the skipjack interim TRP were based (CMM 2015-06). The paper presents a comparable analysis to that of WCPFC-MOW3-WP-03 (SPC-OFP, 2014), using the agreed 2019 skipjack assessment, and indicates changes in effort and biomass (depletion) from 2012 and recent (2015-2018 average) levels, and median equilibrium yield (as a proportion of MSY) associated with strategies that maintain a median of spawning biomass depletion (SB/SBF=0) at Commission-specified depletion levels. These are compared to the results under 2012 ‘baseline’ fishing levels (2012 effort levels in the purse seine fishery, recent 2016-2018 catch levels in Indonesia/Philippines/Vietnam domestic fisheries). WCPFC17 requested examination of candidate revised interim skipjack TRPs between 36% and 50% of SBF=0, which are presented in the paper. In 2021, the first tropical tuna workshop (TTMW1) requested these analyses also report fishing mortality levels consistent with those % SBF=0 levels, along with the change in biomass (depletion) from 2007-2009 average levels. These are presented in the paper to ensure WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  19    all information is contained in one place. The other information requested by WCPFC16 to aid discussions (paras. 258 and 259 of the WCPFC16 Summary Report), which were reported to previous meetings, are in Annex 3 (formulation of TRPs, impact of effort creep)."
WCPFC18,93,"Under baseline (2012) fishing levels the stock is predicted, on average, to fall slightly compared to ‘recent’ (2015-2018) levels (44% SBF=0), to 42% SBF=0. This is very slightly below 2012 depletion levels but is an equivalent % SBF=0 value at 2 decimal places. Examining the four other median depletion levels requested by WCPFC16 (50%, 48%, 46% and 44% SBF=0), these levels (i) imply reductions in purse seine effort from 2012 levels of 7% to 25%, (ii) lead to predicted increases in spawning biomass from 2012 levels of between 3% and 18%, and either maintain biomass at recent assessed levels, or predict an increase in biomass by 5% to 13%. Total equilibrium yield is predicted to reduce compared to that under 2012 ‘baseline’ levels, to 78%-95% of MSY. For the three median depletion levels requested by WCPFC17 (36%, 38% and 40%), these levels imply increases in purse seine effort from 2012 levels of 5% to 30%, and lead to predicted decreases in spawning biomass from 2012 levels of 5% to 14%. Total equilibrium yield is predicted to increase very slightly compared to that under 2012 ‘baseline’ levels, to 98% of MSY (reaching the flatter peak of the yield curve). There was no risk of falling below the LRP associated with any of these depletion levels based on the current uncertainty framework. To address the request of the TTMW1 for estimated fishing mortality (F) under each candidate depletion level, the paper presents resulting stock-wide age-averaged F for juvenile and adult components of the population and median fishing mortality-at-age. TTMW1 also requested a calculation of recent fishing mortality levels as proportions of 2012 and 2012-2015 levels. Interpretation of the results is challenging given that future fishing mortality is strongly influenced by the required settings within the projection, in particular that future domestic fishery and pole-and-line catches continue at set levels (2016-2018 and 2012 respectively), while purse seine is projected on effort. The composition of gears within the projected fishery and their impacts on the stock will therefore change relative to that in the historical (2012) period. This is clear when examining the relative change in fishing mortality in juvenile and adult segments of the population, with that on juveniles increasing notably at all examined depletion levels. This was driven by significant increases in fishing mortality within Region 5 of the skipjack assessment model (the western tropical WCPO encompassing Indonesia and Philippines), where future domestic fishery catches continue at 2016-2018 levels. SPC noted that a skipjack stock assessment will be undertaken in 2022 and reviewed at SC18."
WCPFC18,94,"Tonga on behalf of FFA members thanked SPC for the analyses and stated it is unfortunate that, for a range of reasons, the Commission has been unable to devote significant time to progressing harvest strategy work over the last two years.  FFA members also noted that over that period they had maintained a clear position on recalibrating the skipjack TRP, noting that the stock is healthy, but some Commission members had been unwilling to support their proposals that would ensure that the target is in line with the current understanding of the status of this stock. FFA members stated their commitment to progressing harvest strategy work in 2022 and beyond, including the adoption of a skipjack TRP in 2022."
WCPFC18,95,"In response to a query from American Samoa, SPC presented figures for the skipjack catch in 2012 vs. 2020, as contained in WCPFC18-2021-IP02_rev1."
WCPFC18,96,"In response to a query from Indonesia, SPC indicated that 50% of skipjack are considered mature at 1 year old, with an estimated size of about 50 cm, and noted that estimated fishing mortality in Region 5 was relatively high in that size range."
WCPFC18,97,"The EU stated that it appears the analyses assume the FAD closures don’t affect the status of skipjack because selectivity is similar, with reduced effort on FADs offset by fishing on free schools, and inquired how confident SPC was in that assumption. The EU noted that despite the decrease in effort, catches have remained at a high level, and inquired whether there was any information on the trend in effort creep in recent years? SPC stated that there were some differences between the analysis presented and those done WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  20    for the tropical tuna CMM. The analysis in the paper assumes patterns of fishing and FAD closures continue into the future. The tropical tuna measure analyses assume there is no major impact from FAD closures on the skipjack population; the impact comes from the number of sets being made, because there are generally similar impacts from free school and FAD-associated sets. Regarding effort creep SPC stated it provides its best estimates every year (in 2021 in SC17-MI-IP-06), but effort creep is not included in the analyses presented to WCPFC18. SPC explained that it does not know what the level of future effort creep will be, and the aim is to define a TRP stock depletion level that meets the Commission’s objectives. Management action must then aim to achieve that TRP, taking into account and adjusting to technology changes within the fishery.  SPC referenced Annex 3 of WCPFC18-2021-10 (Effort creep estimated in relation to the TRPs)."
WCPFC18,98,"PNG, on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, supported the FFA statement by Tonga. They observed that agreement on a revised skipjack TRP has been held up for 3 years largely because some CCMs tried to take advantage of what should have been a simple technical adjustment to the interim skipjack TRP, and that this was the main reason that MSC certifications of WCPO tuna fisheries faced suspension. The PNA and Tokelau stated they hoped the Commission could give priority to Harvest Strategy work in 2022, including reaching agreement on a skipjack TRP."
WCPFC18,99,"Japan stated it would like to discuss the issue raised by the PNA and Tokelau during WCPFC18, with a goal of reaching an agreement."
WCPFC18,100,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC and advice from SC17 on possible formulations of a TRP for skipjack tuna.
WCPFC18,101,The Commission noted the importance of agreeing on TRP for skipjack and agreed to progress this work in 2022.  7.2.1.2 Target reference point for bigeye and yellowfin
WCPFC18,102,"Dr. Steven Hare (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-11. Updated WCPO bigeye and yellowfin TRP evaluations. In 2020, SC16 agreed on new stock assessments for WCPO bigeye and yellowfin tuna that indicated both stocks are on average not overfished nor subject to overfishing. Based on those assessments, the paper presents results of analyses requested by SC16, WCPFC16 and SC17, to assist WCPFC18 in the identification of interim TRPs for WCPO bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks. It presents the consequences for each stock and fishery of SC16-defined stock depletion levels (SB/SBF=0) consistent with specified historical conditions and stock risk levels (paras. 76–78 of the SC16 Outcomes Document). For each depletion level, results are presented comparable to those in WCPFC-SC16-2020/MI-WP-02 for skipjack tuna, indicating changes in biomass from both 2012-2015 and recent (2015-2018 average) levels, changes in fishing from baseline (2016-2018 average) levels, median equilibrium yield (as a proportion of MSY), risk relative to the agreed LRP, and SC16-requested per-recruit metrics. Full results are summarised in the tables in WCPFC18-2021-11. In response to a request from WCPFC17, additional analyses were conducted to facilitate examination of the multi-species implications of harvest levels that achieve the different TRPs for each species (yellowfin and bigeye under the two recruitment assumptions). The resultant depletion levels for skipjack and yellowfin (under bigeye TRP calculations), and for skipjack and bigeye (under yellowfin TRP calculations) are computed and provided. Within this analysis both the overall purse seine effort and longline catch is increased or decreased by the scalar specified; this is a different assumption to that of (for example) the evaluation of the tropical tuna CMM for skipjack, where overall purse seine effort is assumed to remain constant. SC17 requested that the potential consequences of the candidate TRPs for South Pacific albacore depletion be examined, and these are presented. Outcomes for skipjack and South Pacific albacore are provided in the main text of the paper.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  21"
WCPFC18,103,"Dr. Hare stated that under baseline (2016-2018 average) fishing conditions, both bigeye and yellowfin stocks were projected to increase relative to 2012-2015 average levels, and either remain at recent (2015-2018 average) levels (yellowfin) or increase (bigeye). For both bigeye and yellowfin, CMM 2020-01 specifies that, pending agreement on a TRP, the spawning biomass depletion ratio (SB/SBF=0) is to be maintained at or above the average SB/SBF=0 for 2012-2015. Achieving that depletion level for bigeye implied increases in fishing from 2016-2018 levels by 38% (assuming recent recruitment) and 22% (assuming long-term recruitment) and resulted in a risk of falling below the limit reference point (LRP) of 3% or 14% (recent and long-term recruitment, respectively). For yellowfin, it implied increased fishing by 29%, and no calculated risk of falling below the LRP. The implications of achieving depletion levels +/- 10% from the 2012-2015 average levels are presented in the tables. An alternative SC16-specified candidate reference point was equivalent to 2000-2004 average depletion levels. For bigeye, this depletion level required fishing to be reduced by 4% (recent recruitment) or 17% (long-term recruitment), and resulted in no, or a minimal (1% assuming long-term recruitment patterns), risk of falling below the LRP. For yellowfin, 2000-2004 average depletion levels implied increasing fishing by 34% from baseline levels, and there was no risk of falling below the LRP calculated at that level. Final SC16-specified depletion levels related to those equivalent to a 10% and 20% risk of falling below the LRP. For bigeye, this implied increases in fishing by 55% and 70% (recent recruitment) and 12% and 33% (long-term recruitment), respectively. Under recent recruitments, those risk levels were achieved at stock sizes 12%-23% lower than 2012-2015 levels. Under the less productive long-term recruitment assumption those risk levels implied a 6% less depleted stock and 10% more depleted stock respectively, relative to 2012-2015 average depletion. For yellowfin, 200% greater fishing than baseline levels (a scalar of 3) was required to achieve a 10% risk level; this was considered unrealistic, and a 20% risk-based depletion level was therefore not pursued further for this stock."
WCPFC18,104,"Dr. Hare noted that with reference to the risk-related depletion levels, which represent ‘minimum’ TRP values consistent with those risk levels, the choice of a TRP can be based on a combination of biological, ecological, and socio-economic considerations, which would likely imply higher TRP levels than the ‘minimum’ TRPs calculated. As agreed at SC16, within this analysis purse seine effort and longline catch are ‘scaled’ equally relative to baseline levels. Scalars are applied to overall purse seine effort – i.e., both associated and unassociated sets are increased or decreased, with the relative pattern reflecting that over the 2016-2018 baseline period. Results will therefore generally differ from that in the CMM 2018-01 evaluation that was presented to WCPFC17 (WCPFC17-2020-14_rev 1). SPC noted that candidate TRP levels can be achieved under different combinations of future purse seine and longline catch/effort levels, which will have implications for the other metrics calculated. If desired, identification of a limited subset of candidate interim TRP levels is strongly recommended before that style of analysis is undertaken. As noted in previous papers discussing TRP formulation, there is a need to have specific language defining the TRP level, based upon the management objective that the TRP is designed to achieve. That language needs to be suitably specific so that the TRP can be recalculated in the case that in the future, new biological or fishery knowledge leads to an updated perception of stock status from the stock assessments. The new information incorporated within the 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment implies a more robust stock than estimated previously, as seen by the minimal risks of falling below the LRP identified at the levels identified here. SPC noted that key areas for further work on the yellowfin assessment were identified for 2022, and an external review of the assessment is also planned (WCPFC-SC17-WP-06). While the assessment is viewed as the best scientific information currently available, the further work underway may lead to changes in the perception of stock status and robustness."
WCPFC18,105,"The USA noted the updated analyses, including the new information on the multispecies impacts. It stated that given the differing interests of CCMs in the tropical tuna fisheries and the sometimes very different operational characteristics of their respective fisheries, a reasonable starting point — and perhaps end point — for developing TRPs is to create an appropriate buffer for the LRP.  In other words, it makes sense to focus on the risk of breaching the LRP rather than, for example, arbitrary time periods. Given that, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  22    and recalling the Commission’s decision that LRP risk levels as high as 20% are consistent with the Convention’s requirement that the risk be “very low,” the USA suggested that LRP risk levels of 10% would constitute appropriate LRPs for both bigeye and yellowfin, and supported their adoption, understanding that important work would remain to operationalize them, as the TRPs would compete with each other. It noted that LRP risk levels could be translated into stock sizes, exploitation rates, or other measures, but stated that there is little reason to do so, and expressing the TRPs solely in terms of LRP risk levels would obviate the need to periodically recalibrate the TRPs if they are expressed in other measures like stock size. The USA stated it was prepared to move forward and adopt TRPs for these two stocks as it had proposed."
WCPFC18,106,"Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, thanked SPC and noted the 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment implies a more robust stock than estimated previously. They acknowledged that due to uncertainty in this stock assessment an external review is planned for 2022, and further work is underway that may lead to changes in the perception of stock status and robustness. FFA members stated the updates were very timely as they facilitate an improved understanding of multi-species implications of alternative harvest levels, presenting for the first time the resultant depletion levels for skipjack, yellowfin and South Pacific albacore under bigeye tuna TRP calculations, and for skipjack, bigeye and South Pacific albacore under yellowfin tuna TRP calculations. They stated this would greatly aid in considering candidate TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin tuna. FFA members stated that the decision on TRPs for these stocks is critical and has major implications for the management of WCPFC fisheries. FFA members noted that yellowfin and bigeye are central stocks for FFA members, important in both purse seine and longline fisheries, and having a clear understanding of the trade-offs associated with potential TRPs is essential; unfortunately given the ongoing impacts of COVID on the business of the Commission, and the major time and effort that has been consumed renegotiating the tropical tuna measure, FFA members stated that they have not been able to devote the time and energy to properly consider these decisions, and have not been able to undertake the consultation with other WCPFC members that would be necessary to reach consensus."
WCPFC18,107,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC of the results of analyses on candidate TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin.
WCPFC18,108,The Commission noted the importance of agreeing on TRP for bigeye and yellowfin and agreed to progress this work in 2022.  7.2.1.3 Management procedures for skipjack
WCPFC18,109,The Chair noted that two reference papers had been prepared: WCPFC18-2021-13. SPC. Evaluations of candidate management procedures for skipjack tuna in the WCPO; and WCPFC18-2021-12.
WCPFC18,110,"In light of the need to prioritise discussion on the new tropical tuna measure, CCMs agreed to defer consideration of candidate management procedures for skipjack."
WCPFC18,111,The Commission agreed to defer consideration of management procedures for skipjack until 2022.  7.2.2 Proposed New Measure for Tropical Tuna
WCPFC18,112,"The Chair prefaced consideration of the tropical tuna CMM at WCPFC18 by noting the work done during 2021, including two workshops on Development of a New WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  23    (Workshop 1, held 26–30 April, and the associated Chair’s Report of TTMW1; and  Workshop 2, held 6–10 September, and the associated Chair’s Report of TTMW2). The workshops provided an opportunity to clarify CCMs’ views on many elements of the tropical tuna measure, and resulted in a number of requests being made of the SSP for further analyses; results of these analyses are summarised in WCPFC18-2021-15 (addressed under Agenda Item 7.2.2.1). Statements and proposals offered by CCMs at the workshops are posted on the WCPFC18 meeting pages as WCPFC-TTMW1-2021-DP01 through WCPFC-TTMW1-2021-DP06, and WCPFC-TTMW2-2021-DP01 through WCPFC-TTMW2-2021-DP03). Subsequently, the Chair prepared a Consultative Draft for the new tropical tuna CMM (Circular 2021/82, dated 01 October 2021). Following submission of comments by a number of CCMs, a revised Consultative Draft was issued on 01 November 2021 (Circular 2021/94), and issued as WCPFC18-2021-16. WCPFC Chair. Chair’s Consultative Draft CMM for Tropical Tunas."
WCPFC18,113,"The Chair noted that the November Consultative Draft reflected written comments received from the United States of America, Japan, Chinese Taipei, Korea, the European Union, FFA (representing Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu), and the SPG (Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu). Given the substantive and valuable nature of the comments from CCMs, and for the purposes of transparency, the Secretariat posted all the comments received on the October Consultative Draft to the WCPFC18 meeting page (WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP01 through WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09)."
WCPFC18,114,"The Chair outlined the approach taken in including CCMs’ comments in the Consultative Draft, and highlighted the key elements:  • Bigeye and Skipjack management objectives • Addition of a spatial element • FAD closures and FAD-related elements (e.g., instrumented buoys and non-entangling FADs) • Timeframe for decisions on allocation • Longline MCS measures • Longline catch limits • Purse seine high seas effort limits • Other commercial fisheries • Operational data"
WCPFC18,115,"At the request of the Chair, the Commission’s consideration of the tropical tuna CMM at WCPFC18 began with statements from CCMs that had prepared written submissions in response to the Chair’s November Consultative Draft.  Introductory statements from CCMs"
WCPFC18,116,"The EU welcomed the transparent and inclusive approach adopted by the Chair, and focussed on the following suggestions to improve and strengthen the measure. (i) The EU suggested a revision in Paragraph 4, requiring that if coastal states adopt measures in archipelagic waters and territorial seas that are consistent with the CMM they inform the Secretariat of the relevant measure. The EU noted that this would allow the Commission to have a full picture of how tropical tuna fisheries are regulated and managed across the WCPFC-CA.  (ii) The EU suggested an addition to Paragraph 8 to clarify the issue of attribution of catch for purse seine vessels under charter arrangements, with the aim to ensure that the exemptions under Footnote 1 cannot be used by vessels flagged to non-SIDS under chartering arrangements, which the EU stated WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  24    in this specific case do not seem to provide any benefit to SIDS. The EU stated that this would remove an existing loophole from the management framework and facilitate the work of TCC.  (iii) With regard to FAD management, to facilitate discussions at TCC and clarify the use of the exemptions under Footnote 1, the EU suggested an addition to paragraph 16 that would require that the Secretariat provides at the end of each fishing season a list of fishing vessels that have not applied the FAD closure in that specific fishing season.  (iv) The EU also proposed the adoption of  fully non-entangling FADs by banning the use of mesh net from the FAD, as this would eliminate the threat of ghost fishing from FADs, and suggested that the language and commitment regarding the move to introduce biodegradable FADs be more ambitious; regarding the monitoring of instrumented buoys, the EU proposed adding a reporting requirement to allow the Secretariat to assess compliance and ensure SPC receives the information for its scientific work aiming at improving FAD management.  (v) Regarding high seas purse seine effort, the EU supported retention of Table 2 in Attachment 1, noting high seas purse seine effort of CCMs not bound under the current measure has been increasing. The EU suggested that a temporary cap to that additional component of the high seas purse seine effort be added for the duration of the current CMM. This would be a collective 3,000 days to be allocated among SIDS CCMs. This would ensure that all components of tropical tuna fishing mortality are effectively managed in the framework of the CMM.  (vi) The EU also suggested that catch retention provisions be adopted for longline and other commercial fisheries, to mirror those already in place for the purse seine fleet; this would concern the three tropical tuna species.  (vii) The EU also proposed inclusion of a “no data, no fish” to prohibit CCMs that do not provide their list of active vessels and the catch and effort data required by the Commission, in accordance with WCPFC reporting requirements, for one or more species for a given year, from retaining such species as of the year following."
WCPFC18,117,"Chinese Taipei stated that for the general provisions its goal is that in the long run the Commission removes all exemptions, noting that all CCMs should make contributions to conserve the species; it stated that there may be a need for special arrangements in the short term, but the purpose of these should be clarified. Chinese Taipei made the following comments regarding specific elements of the CMM. (i) For purse seine fisheries: regarding FADs, Chinese Taipei stated it would like to revise the 1 nautical mile (nm) rule to 0.5 nm. Chinese Taipei also stated it sought to retain the current “small garbage” provisions, which are very important for the MCS. Regarding biodegradable and non-entangling FADs, Chinese Taipei supported continuation of the discussion on these issues through the FAD-MO SWG.  (ii) Regarding the longline fisheries, Chinese Taipei noted the need to rebalance the current tropical tuna measure by increasing the longline bigeye catch limit, as the longline fishery has sacrificed more than other fisheries.  (iii) Chinese Taipei also stated that the Commission should take onboard the advice from TCC and SC on other commercial fisheries."
WCPFC18,118,"Fiji on behalf of FFA members stated they would not consider any changes to the CMM that affects the current careful balance of interests between fisheries and CCMs, which they stated has been achieved after a lengthy period of careful and considered development. FFA members stated that if there are to be changes within the CMM, the rationale for those proposed changes needs to be compelling and the balance needs to be maintained. FFA members stated they take the advice of SC very seriously and insist on a cautious approach to any changes to the existing measures. They also noted that, following SC’s significant technical concerns, there will be an independent review in 2022 of the stock assessments for bigeye and yellowfin tuna; until the outcomes of this review are available any revisions to the CMM need to be suitably precautionary. Based on these criteria, FFA members stated that they had proposed a number of carefully WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  25    considered changes to the CMM that have been included in the Chair’s Consultative Draft. The FFA proposals include requirements for the use of non-entangling materials in FAD construction as well as a re-specification of the timeframes for the Commission’s consideration of allocation frameworks for high seas limits for both purse seine and longline fisheries, and recognition of the management arrangements applied by FFA members to manage the fishing activity taking place within their EEZs. FFA members stated that the Commission has an opportunity to address one of the key gaps in the Commission’s management frameworks: the lack of effective monitoring of high seas fishing activity by longline vessels. FFA members stated they seek to include a range of MCS elements for longline fisheries in the new tropical tuna measure, with firm commitments to progress these, which they stated are essential for addressing the gap in monitoring of longline activity, particularly on the high seas. FFA members stated that most importantly, and in recognition of their sovereign rights under international law, longline fishing within their EEZs would be managed only through zone-based management, including the LL-VDS, which is currently applied by PNA members plus Tokelau. FFA members also emphasised the ultimate intention, as proposed in the text provided in relation to paragraph 44 of the revised CMM, to transition towards an equitable framework for allocation of high seas fishing opportunities in the bigeye longline fishery. Finally, recognising the United Nations’ Climate Change Sustainable Development Goal to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”, and that climate change has particularly negative impacts on SIDS, FFA members suggested climate change be included in the preamble to the measure in acknowledgment of the impact of climate change on fisheries, and the disproportionate consequences on the region."
WCPFC18,119,"Japan observed that in the WCPFC-CA many types of fishing gear are used to target tuna species, and that the CMM should take into account the interest and balance of these different fisheries. Japan noted that while the 2020 bigeye stock assessment indicated the biological status of the stock is healthy, the recent biomass levels are insufficient for some fisheries that rely on these stocks. The CPUE of Japan’s longline fishery, whose main target is bigeye tuna, has deceased in recent years, with poor catch.  Japan maintained its position that the TRP for bigeye should be set as median SB/SBF=0 for 2000-2004. For the skipjack TRP Japan stated its understanding that this was agreed in accordance with the recommendation from SC10 in 2014 that the Commission take action to limit further increases in fishing mortality and keep the skipjack stock around the (then) current level. Japan stated that from this point of view selection of 2012 as a reference year as proposed by FFA was acceptable; Japan stated it could consider the FFA proposal positively and work with FFA and others on this issue. Regarding Charter arrangements, Japan stated that the provision of the current paragraph leaves room for interpretation, and to avoid future disputes among CCMs Japan advocated revising the text to clearly reflect the understanding of CCMs, especially the distinction between high seas and EEZs where non-SIDS vessels are chartered by SIDS. Regarding FAD management, while Japan stated it agreed on the direction to strengthen the regulation on non-entangling FAD, Japan requested that a transition period be established so that purse seiners could prepare non-entangling FADs compliant with the paragraph. Japan supported development of biodegradable FADs, and suggested the need to define “biodegradable” in this context. Regarding management of longline fisheries, Japan noted FFA’s proposed revisions regarding bigeye catch limits, and suggested the goal of moving to zone-based management be discussed, with a view to reaching agreement in 2023. In closing Japan noted again that bigeye tuna are caught by many different vessels in its EEZ, and indicated its interest in addressing these issues with other CCMs as both a coastal and distant water fishing nation."
WCPFC18,120,"Korea offered comments on the following key issues. Regarding management objectives for bigeye and yellowfin, Korea stated that if the current objectives are retained it expects there will be some increases in fishing opportunities, based on advice from SPC and various socioeconomic factors. For skipjack, SPC has presented several options, which Korea stated should be discussed by CCMs. Regarding FAD management, Korea stated the need to address the issue of fishers’ unknowingly setting on FADs during FAD closures, which is related to the FAD definition and the 1 nm rule. Korea stated that with respect to the high seas limit for purse seine fisheries, at present some CCMs must reduce their purse seine fishing effort in the high seas by 80% to 90% from historical levels, while others fish with no limits. Koreas stated WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  26    that this is not equitable and likely to undermine purse seine effort control in the high seas and must be rectified. Korea stated its expectation that overall bigeye catch limit for longline fisheries would be increased, and hoped that the Commission could identify an appropriate level of increase. Korea also noted that there are some provisions that exempt SIDS from these requirements, and stated that the Commission needs to pursue a careful balance of the special requirements of SIDS with the need to conserve tuna stocks."
WCPFC18,121,"Niue on behalf of the SPG stated that as SIDS they share strong interests in the sustainable development of the southern longline fisheries for southern albacore, swordfish, bigeye and yellowfin. They noted that SPG members had previously highlighted the need to ensure that the longline provisions of the tropical tuna CMM recognise the sovereign rights of coastal States to manage fishing activity within their EEZs, in accordance with the provisions of the WCPFC and UNCLOS. They stated that any vessel fishing in SPG waters should be managed under their management framework, including any applicable limits, in the same manner that any catch taken in their waters is attributed to the coastal State. The SPG stated it prioritised the development by WCPFC of zone-based management for all longline fisheries, and looked forward to working with other CCMs in developing sustainable and equitable limits that respect rights for the high seas and coastal State sovereign rights for EEZs. They strongly supported the retention of paragraph 44 of the current CMM, including the amendments proposed by FFA, and advocated that WCPFC19 determine hard high seas limits for bigeye in 2022, and apply those limits to CCMs in a manner consistent with their sovereign rights, and Articles 8, 10 (3) and 30 of the Convention. SPG members stated their deep concern about the continuing decline in South Pacific albacore fisheries, and the impact of this on fisheries-dependent economies, noting that the southern fisheries interact with the tropical longline fisheries, and are impacted by changes in tropical longline management, activities and catches. SPG stated it is critical to avoid any increase in longline fishing effort, or increase in bigeye limits, noting that any such increase, particularly south of the equator, would result in additional catches of albacore and place a disproportionate burden on SPG members. Such increases may also result in fleet behavioural changes that could negatively impact on southern longline fisheries. As a result, SPG advocated that the CMM not allow for any overall increase in longline fishing effort, or any overall increase in bigeye limits, stressing that any proposal to increase tropical longline fishing effort, or any overall increase in bigeye longline limits, must consider impacts on SIDs and territories as per CMM 2013-06. SPG stated it would also be seeking further study on the interactions and impacts of longline fishing effort on their southern longline fisheries, and an immediate freeze on albacore catch from the high seas."
WCPFC18,122,"The USA stated that as it made clear in 2020 and through the intersessional work in 2021, it is critical that the CMM be substantially revised at WCPFC18 to address continuing shortcomings. The USA put forward a number of specific suggestions to the TTMW1 and TTMW2, and followed up with specific proposals and views as reflected in the Chair’s consultative draft CMM. The USA highlighted the most important comments and proposals it provided, as contained in WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP02. (i) The USA noted that paragraph 5 speaks to the rights and obligations of SIDS and territories, and that each provision of the new CMM must be considered in light of the special requirements of ALL SIDS, including participating territories.  Therefore, the USA stated that the specific paragraphs cited in paragraph 5 should be subject to change as the details of the new CMM are discussed. (ii) The USA stated it is important to retain Paragraph 9, which speaks to agreements between U.S.-flagged vessels and U.S. participating territories.  The USA stated the importance of this provision, and how it serves the development aspirations of American Samoa, CNMI, and Guam, are described in WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09, which points to specific fisheries development activities that have resulted from these agreements. (iii) The USA offered specific language for the management objectives for each of the three stocks, in paragraphs 12-14: (a) For all three tropical tuna stocks, the USA believes it is crucially important for the Commission to recognize and avoid the risk of severe localized spawning stock depletion.  With that in mind, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  27    it proposed that each of the stock-wide objectives be supplemented with the phrase “and excessive spatial unevenness in spawning biomass depletion is to be avoided to support thriving fisheries throughout the Convention Area. (b) For skipjack tuna, the USA commented is that the TRP itself should not be specified in this CMM, but elsewhere, as is done with other reference points. (iv) Regarding paragraphs 16-17 (FAD closures) the USA stated it sees the need to keep the bigeye-directed controls in the purse seine fishery similar in effect to those in the existing measure. However, the USA stressed the Commission cannot continue to adopt measures that rely on observers to ensure compliance until it resolves the issues relating the sharing of observer reports between ROP Providers and CCMs that need them for investigations. The USA stated that for that reason, it could not support inclusion of FAD closures or limits on FAD sets without a clear understanding that progress is being made to resolve the observer report issue.   (v) The USA stated it had commented on exemptions to the FAD closures, currently in Footnotes 1 and 2, observing that these exemptions have served their purpose of facilitating the development of certain members’ purse seine fisheries, and that it was time to end these. It stated that if agreement could be reached to remove the exemptions at WCPFC18, then the Commission must review the impacts of the FAD closures among CCMs and revisit the exemptions to ensure the closures do not result in a disproportionate burden of conservation action on any SIDS, including participating territories. It stated that in particular, the tuna-dependent economy of American Samoa is being significantly adversely impacted by the closures and their uneven application. (vi) The USA stated it had not provided specific comments on the purse seine fishing effort limits in paragraphs 25 and 26 and Table 1 and 2 of Attachment 1, but would offer drafting suggestions to suit the needs of CCMs, including all SIDS.   (vii) For monitoring and control in the longline fishery, the USA proposed increasing the minimum level of observer coverage in all longline fisheries from 5% to 10%, effective January 1, 2023, noting that increased coverage in the longline fishery is clearly needed to meet the scientific and compliance needs of the Commission. (viii) Regarding the longline bigeye tuna catch limits in paragraph 39, the USA supported adding limits for all CCMs that are not currently limited, and increases to some of the existing limits in Table 3 of Attachment 1. It noted that some members’ catch limits had been severely underused since they were adopted, and stated that the proposed changes would constitute an increase of 12,000 mt in the limits collectively, slightly more than those annual underages. It stated that the revised limits, even if fully utilized, would keep the spawning stock well above the level in the existing management objective and presented a very low (close-to-zero) risk of breaching the LRP.   (ix) The USA stated that Paragraph 44 calls for the Commission to agree on hard limits for bigeye and a framework to allocate those limits among all Members and Participating Territories.  It stated that if the Commission was unable to establish longline bigeye tuna limits for all CCMs at this meeting, the USA would support retention of this paragraph with some adjustments. It stated it would be open to revisions that recognize FFA members’ interest in incorporating a zone-based aspect into the Commission’s management of the longline fishery for bigeye tuna, but that the task set forth in this paragraph must not be narrowed to just the high seas. Second, the USA supported revisions that recognize the need to avoid localized spawning biomass depletion and the utility of a spatially tailored management scheme to do so. It noted that this concept of spatially-based management was not in conflict with the FFA members’ desire to shift to a zone-based management scheme. (x) The USA noted its companion paper, WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09, was submitted on behalf of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the United States and served two purposes, both related to CCM’s collective obligation to ensure that CMMs do not transfer a disproportionate burden of conservation onto any SIDS, including participating territories: (a) it provides information about the fisheries and economies of the three U.S. territories, which the USA stated could be used by the Commission to help assess impacts of CMMs generally on these three SIDS; and (b) contains information about the expected impacts on SIDS of particular WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  28    provisions that have been proposed by the USA, as well as of provisions proposed or promoted by other CCMs. It noted that the information was presented using the CMM 2013-06 assessment framework."
WCPFC18,123,"American Samoa emphasized the overwhelming dependence of American Samoa on the tuna industry, which provides 84% of its private employment and accounts for more than 99% of the value of its exports. It stated that its economy is suffering from the unintended consequences of the tuna measure, one of which is reflagging, noting that U.S.-flagged vessels have been moving to other flags in pursuit of better economic and operating conditions. American Samoa stated that many of the vessels that have left the U.S. flag are now flagged to Pacific Island countries that do not have high seas limits and that exempt their vessels from the FAD closures; as a result, port calls to Pago Pago have greatly diminished. In addition, vessels are fishing farther from American Samoa, in waters where they don’t have to pay for access and where they are not subject to limits or FAD closures. Those more distant fishing grounds make American Samoa less attractive for unloading. American Samoa stated that reduced port calls impact the supply of tuna to its cannery and damage its tuna-dependent economy. It stated that each purse seiner’s direct delivery to Pago Pago represents spending of about $400,000 for fuel, food, supplies, repairs and services, but direct deliveries are down almost 50% from 2020, which was a direct loss to the economy of over $10 million for 2021 alone, not counting what the canneries lost due to reduced production and lost sales. In four of the last six years, the high seas in the WCPFC-CA were closed to U.S. vessels as a result of reaching the limit on fishing effort. American Samoa stated that because its cannery depends so strongly on U.S.-flagged vessels, the consequences of those closures have been enormous. The economic losses in American Samoa from the closure in 2015 alone were estimated at $11 million to $110 million. In addition to the loss in commerce, represented by what the boats spend, is the loss of raw material; American Samoa stated that all tuna processors require an economical and reliable source of tuna in order to be viable, which it had that with its locally based fleet of purse seiners. It stated that the decimation of the locally based tuna purse seine fleet threatens to destroy the tuna industry, and the loss of the locally based purse seiner fleet would result in American Samoa losing its reliable and economical raw material supply, and one of the main reasons the tuna processing industry exists in American Samoa. It stated that in summary, the existing measure is seriously unfair for American Samoa, is not working well, and needs to be changed. It stated that in developing a new tuna measure, the Commission must recognize the special requirements and interests of American Samoa as a SIDS that is highly dependent on tuna resources, noting that the Commission has a clear responsibility in this regard under Article 30 of the Convention, and that it was time for the Commission to fulfil that responsibility with respect to American Samoa."
WCPFC18,124,"PNG on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau supported the FFA position in advocating a precautionary approach to changes to the current measures in the CMM, and supported the FFA position to maintain the current careful balance of interests between fisheries and CCMs in the CMM. They stated that this was substantially based around the agreement on bigeye conservation that was made in Busan to reduce longline catch limits by 30% and apply a 3 months FAD closure. Despite the heavy costs and increasingly disproportionate burden of the FAD closure, PNA and Tokelau stated they supported maintaining the current FAD closure as part of taking a precautionary approach to the development of the new CMM, provided the integrity of the current FAD closure arrangements is maintained, and the other elements of the package of measures that conserve bigeye are also maintained, including the longline bigeye catch limits, the high seas FAD closure and the high seas purse seine effort limits. They stressed that longline bigeye catch limits are part of the package of measures to conserve bigeye, and if increases in longline bigeye catch limits are to be considered, the FAD closure would need to be reduced or removed; zone-based management, including the longline VDS, would need to be implemented as proposed by the FFA-suggested revision to paragraph 39; and longline MCS would need to be strengthened.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  29    Tropical Tuna Measure Deliberations"
WCPFC18,125,"Following the presentation of CCMs’ introductory statements, and consideration of related issues, for example the status of WCPO tuna stocks (Agenda Item 7.1), the setting of TRPs (7.2.1.1-7.2.1.2), SPC’s analyses relevant to the tropical tuna measure (7.2.2.1), and the report of the FAD-MO IWG (7.2.2.2), the Commission considered the tropical tuna measure at WCPFC18 in the course of a number of discussion sessions in plenary as well as three closed meetings among the Heads of Delegations. CCMs agreed that significant changes to the core elements of the measure, involving FAD closures, high seas purse seine effort control, longline MCS measures, and longline bigeye catch limits, would be necessarily made in conjunction (as a “package”)."
WCPFC18,126,"In the course of their discussions CCMs agreed to retain those elements of the current measure for which there was a lack of consensus regarding proposed revisions. This decision was made following significant deliberation, and was supported by CCMs in view of: • ongoing efforts to develop harvest strategies for the main tuna stocks;  • the acknowledged success of CMM 2020-01 and its predecessors in meeting the Commission’s objectives with regard to maintaining their objectives for these stocks; and  • the complexity of the negotiations regarding the central package of elements in the CMM, particularly given the challenges of the virtual meeting format."
WCPFC18,127," The succeeding paragraphs provide a summary of views offered by CCMs on significant elements of the CMM, and the consensus reached by the Commission with respect to those elements in its development of CMM 2021-01.    Charter Measures"
WCPFC18,128,"A number of CCMs argued for retention of the existing charter measures, noting these provide coastal states with opportunities to develop their domestic fisheries in partnership with distant water fishing nations. A CCM supported addressing whether the chartering arrangements could be the opportunity for non-SIDS to make use of the benefits granted to SIDS. Differing views were expressed over retention of a paragraph attributing the catches and efforts of United States flagged vessels operating under agreements with its participating territories to those territories. Consensus was not reached on revisions to these elements, so the existing CMM’s charter provisions were not substantially revised.  Interim objectives for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna"
WCPFC18,129,"Some CCMs argued for retention of the current objectives for bigeye and yellowfin, noting the need to maintain a precautionary approach pending establishment of TRPs for these species, and the outcomes of the yellowfin stock assessment review being conducted in 2022. A number of CCMs also referenced ongoing efforts to transition to a harvest strategy approach to these stocks and advocated against expending significant effort to revise the existing objectives. Some CCMs suggested the skipjack TRP be modified in line with recent scientific advice, or deleted. A number of CCMs stated that despite their reluctance to extending the current skipjack TRP, they would agree to do so given the lack of time, and need to reach agreement on the CMM as a whole. One CCM advocated adopting a spatial approach to objectives for these stocks that reflects spatial differences in exploitation patterns. Consideration was also given to deletion of the objectives for all three stocks. Consensus was not reached on revisions to these elements, and the existing CMM’s interim objectives for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna were not revised.    WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  30    Purse Seine Fishery FAD Closures"
WCPFC18,130,"CCMs agreed that, in the absence of changes to other essential elements of the CMM, the FAD closures would be retained. All CCMs agreed regarding the importance of the FAD closures as a core conservation element of the current tropical tuna CMM, while some CCMs expressed concern regarding the difficulties in enforcing this aspect of the CMM given that it relies on observer reports, and noting that issues related to access by Flag States to observer reports were related to a significant number of the unresolved cases in the CCFS."
WCPFC18,131,"The USA proposed that the following language be included in the CMM in order to address this issue:  “Recognizing that ensuring compliance with the FAD closures depends on ROP observers and the reports they prepare, WCPFC18 agrees that continuation of the provisions of paragraphs 16 and 17 of the new tropical tuna measure (CMM 2021-XX) after 2022 is dependent on the Commission resolving the problems associated with observer reports being shared in timely manner among CCMs for investigations.  Paragraphs 16 and 17 will cease to be in effect on 1 January 2023 until the Commission adopts specific elements that are to be included in the WCPFC observer reports that are provided by ROP Providers to CCMs for investigations and requirements on the timing of such provision.”"
WCPFC18,132,"Other CCMs stated that while they understood the linkages between the provision of observer reports and the FAD closure element of the tropical tuna CMM, including such a sunset clause in the measure posed an unacceptable risk. A number of CCMs supported inclusion of the following language to reflect the need to address the issue:  “TCC18 will undertake work on the elements of the WCPFC observer report to be provided by ROP Providers to CCMs for investigations.”"
WCPFC18,133,"No consensus was reached, and the issue of provision of observer reports with respect to FAD closures is not addressed in the revised CMM.   FAD Closure Exemptions (Footnote 1)"
WCPFC18,134,"Several CCMs voiced strong support for modifying Footnote 1 (to paragraph 16 in CMM 2020-01) so as to apply to all SIDS, including territories, with a view to addressing the economic hardship experienced by American Samoa, as referenced in WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP02 and WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09. CCMs recognized and sympathized with the economic difficulties faced by American Samoa, and considered a range of approaches to address the issue, including exemptions from the 3-month FAD closure in the U.S. EEZ and the 2-month FAD closure in the high seas for U.S. flagged vessels notified as an integral part of American Samoa’s fishery. Most CCMs stressed the importance of ensuring any exemption treated all SIDS equally, and generally advocated that any exemption apply only to that portion of the U.S. EEZ surrounding American Samoa. No consensus was reached on these proposals, and they are not included in the revised CMM.  Non-entangling FADs"
WCPFC18,135,"CCMs agreed on the importance of reducing the risk of entanglement of sharks, sea turtles and other species in FADs, and incorporated language in CMM 2021-01 prohibiting (as from January 1, 2024) the use of mesh net for any part of a FAD, and requiring the use of non-entangling materials. CCMs agreed on the desirability of using biodegradable materials, and on the need for additional research, and directed SC to WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  31    review research on the use of biodegradable materials on FADs, and to provide specific recommendations related to biodegradable FADs to the Commission in 2022. CCMs also agreed to consider adoption of measures on the implementation of biodegradable FADs at WCPFC20. Instrumented buoys"
WCPFC18,136,"CCMs agreed to retain the existing limit on the number of drifting FADs with activated instrumented buoys, while acknowledging that the impact of the limit (on both reducing the amount of marine debris and controlling the use of FADs) was uncertain, and agreed to review the effectiveness and appropriateness of the limit at WCPFC20, based on consideration of these issues by the FADMO IWG. CCMs also agreed to include elements in the CMM encouraging vessels to responsibly manage the number of drifting FADs deployed, and to take steps to address lost drifting FADs.  Purse seine effort control"
WCPFC18,137,"CCMs agreed on the need to establish hard effort or catch limits in the high seas of the WCPFC-CA and agreed to commence a process to develop that framework in 2022, to enable reaching agreement in 2023.  Longline fishery  Improved monitoring and control"
WCPFC18,138,"Most CCMs agreed on the importance of improving monitoring and control with respect to the longline fishery. A number of approaches were discussed, including requirements to: • provide notification to the Commission prior to entry into and exit from the high seas;  • submit operational level catch and effort data through electronic means; • establish a regional electronic monitoring programme; and • increase the minimum level of observer coverage in longline fisheries from 5% to 10%.  A variety of positions were expressed on these proposals, but CCMs failed to reach consensus on the specifics; no additional monitoring and control measures for the longline fishery were included in the revised CMM.     Allocation"
WCPFC18,139,"Some CCMs advocated for increasing the bigeye catch limit, indicating that recent scientific advice supported such an increase. Other CCMs stressed that a bigeye longline catch limit increase would have to be linked to the establishment of zone-based management and a strengthened MCS for the longline fishery, as well as a decrease in FAD closures, in the interest of maintaining balance among fishing interests. One CCM advocated strongly against any increase in the bigeye catch limit, noting a decline in longline CPUE in their EEZ. In the absence of consensus regarding any revisions, the Commission agreed to retain the existing longline bigeye catch limits. In addition, the Commission committed to transitioning to a more equitable allocation framework for fishing opportunities that takes into account Articles 8, 10(3) and 30 of the Convention and to commencing a process to develop that process in 2022, to enable reaching agreement in 2023 on hard limits for bigeye among all CCMs.  Other Commercial Fisheries"
WCPFC18,140,"CCMs discussed the setting of limits for Indonesia’s “other fisheries” under CMM 2020-01. CCMs noted that the applicability to Indonesia’s domestic fisheries of the Other Commercial Fisheries category under CMM 2020-01 was addressed at SC17 (SC17-2021-ST-WP02) and TCC17 (TCC17-2021-SC17-ST-IP-09), which agreed on the recommendations provided in those papers. TCC17 requested Indonesia and SPC to provide annual catch estimates for the large-fish handline fishery in Indonesia fishing outside archipelagic waters and territorial sea for vessels >30GT, for 2013-2016 along with baseline options (i.,e,  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  32    average of 2013-2016, or maximum in that period); the period was selected due to the absence of reliable data for 2001-2004. The resulting paper (WCPFC18-2021-24) was considered by WCPFC18 under Agenda Item 7.2.3. During the discussions on this issue under Agenda item 7.2.2, CCMs noted that the majority of data provided by Indonesia regarding its domestic fisheries were used to support the scientific work of the Commission, and raised questions regarding data availability and consistency in setting baseline periods. CCMs agreed to refer the issue to SC18 and TCC18 for consideration prior to making any determinations regarding this issue in the context of the tropical tuna measure.   Conclusion"
WCPFC18,141,"In the course of its deliberations at WCPFC18 the Commission agreed to retain the essential elements of CMM 2020-01 with respect to charter measures; interim objectives for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack; FAD closures; and longline allocation and longline MCS measures. The Commission also agreed on the need to establish hard effort or catch limits for the high seas purse seine fishery, and hard limits for the bigeye longline fishery, and to begin a process of deliberation in 2022 with a view to establishing these in 2023. The Commission established a prohibition on the use of mesh net for any part of a FAD beginning in 2024, and agreed to further consider other issues related to FADs (biodegradable FADs, the impact of FADs, and FAD numbers)."
WCPFC18,142,"In concluding the discussions on the tropical tuna measure the Chair acknowledged the efforts of all CCMs, and noted the constructive consultations that demonstrated a shared willingness to work to improve the Commission’s tropical tuna CMM. The Chair noted the improvements made to the CMM, and observed that the in-depth discussions would serve as a foundation for future efforts to improve management of tropical tuna stocks."
WCPFC18,143,"The Commission adopted CMM 2021-01 on the Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Attachment G)."
WCPFC18,144,"Noting potential issues with data availability, the Commission agreed that, at its regular session in 2022, it would agree a baseline period or limit for the Indonesia Large Fish Handline Fishery, based on the Indonesia proposal and advice from SC18 and TCC18.  7.2.2.1  SSP Analysis of Requests by TTMW2"
WCPFC18,145,"Dr. Graham Pilling and Dr. Paul Hammer (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-15. Results of analyses requested by TTMW2 and TTMW1. The first workshop on the development of the new WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure (TTMW1) requested specific analyses from the SSP to help inform Commission members on options for the new tropical tuna measure (Attachment 2 of WCPFC-TTMW1-2021-Chair’s Report). Similarly, the second workshop (TTMW2) requested further specific analyses from the SSP (Attachment 1 of WCPFC-TTMW2-2021-Chair’s Report). The results of all analyses are presented in the WCPFC18-2021-15, grouped into the different categories provided in the Chair’s reports for the two TTMWs (in Appendix 1 and 2, and the summary provided at the beginning of each section). For each analysis, a short methodological summary is provided where necessary, particularly where interpretation of the request by the SSP was necessary to perform the analysis. This is then followed by the results and, where appropriate, key points for CCMs to note when interpreting those results. In its presentation SPC focussed on the requests made from TTMW2, with an emphasis on the assumptions that SPC had to make in doing the analyses, and that CCMs must be aware of when interpreting the results. SPC noted that issues related to TRPs were addressed in WCPFC18-2021-11 by Steven Hare (discussed under Agenda Item 7.2.1.2)."
WCPFC18,146,"Indonesia inquired regarding the FAD closure analyses why the same bigeye fishing scenario combinations (as shown in Table 27 of WCPFC18-2021-15) resulted in an 11% of reaching LRP under the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  33    long-term recruitment scenario, vs. a 0% chance of breaching the LRP under the “recent” recruitment scenario. SPC stated that the recent scenario assumes the recent higher levels of recruitment will continue into the future; this is more optimistic than the longer-term recruitment scenario.  The two scenarios  lead to significant differences in the level of future recruitment, and hence stock productivity. As a result, the same level of fishing drives the stock to a lower level under the long-term (less optimistic recruitment) scenario."
WCPFC18,147,"RMI on behalf of FFA members noted with appreciation the results of the analyses requested by the TTMW2, and stated they would comment on these in the respective agenda items."
WCPFC18,148,The Commission noted the analyses undertaken by the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) as requested by the Tropical Tuna Measure Workshops.  7.2.2.2 Report of the FADMO IWG
WCPFC18,149,"The Chair of the FADMO-IWG (Mr Jamal James of FSM) stated that in 2020 the IWG finalized draft guidelines for non-entangling and biodegradable FADs. These were presented to WCPFC17, which tasked SC17 and TCC17 to review the draft guidelines prepared by the FAD IWG, and directed the IWG to review the draft guidelines based on SC17 and TCC17 input, as well as any additional information on non-entangling and bio-degradable FADs. The 2021 FADMO-IWG was reconvened via email on 15 October, mainly focusing on reviewing the guidelines as tasked. SC17 discussions on the draft guidelines took place through the SC17 ODF. The IWG noted general support to strengthen the existing provisions to reduce entanglement on FADs as proposed by the FADMO-IWG, with a transition period prior to full implementation of non-entangling FADs. The IWG also noted that research on the use of biodegradable materials has been delayed due to the impacts of COVID-19 and more work was needed on the use of biodegradable materials before further requirements are put in place. TCC17 also noted general support for the use of non-entangling and biodegradable FAD materials, and the need for research on the development and application of suitable biodegradable materials in FAD construction, including the use of locally available materials. A majority of CCMs supported full implementation of non-entangling FADs as soon as possible, noting the challenges and difficulties faced by other CCMs (e.g., logistical concerns regarding access to materials, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic). The FADMO-IWG noted that there were no specific recommendations from SC17 and TCC17 related to the guidelines. The IWG also noted a project on non-entangling and biodegradable FAD trials in the WCPO funded by the EU, USA and ISSF, which is expected to provide essential information to the tuna industry on the design, materials, performance, and cost-effectiveness of non-entangling and biodegradable FADs in the WCPO context, and support increased uptake of more ecologically sustainable FAD designs by industry. The project is expected to be completed in late 2023.  The FADMO-IWG Chair stated that IWG members supported moves to ban netting on FADs or the exclusive use of non-entangling materials and designs to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of entanglement of sharks, sea turtles, cetaceans and other vulnerable species, with the timing to be determined by the Commission, noting the research delays and ongoing supply chain disruptions. The updated draft Guidelines for Non-Entangling and Biodegradable FAD Materials are in Annex A of FADMO-IWG-05-2021-WP-01."
WCPFC18,150,"Nauru, on behalf of FFA members, stated that many of the findings made by the fifth session of the FADMO-IWG were consistent with those proposed by FFA members in the Chair’s Consultative Draft, including supporting the banning of mesh netting on FADs and using only non-entangling materials and designs. FFA members stated they also support including a suitable transition period before provisions on the requirements for the use of non-entangling materials come into effect. FFA members endorsed the recommendation for further scientific studies into the development and application of appropriate WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  34    biodegradable materials in FAD construction, including the use of local materials and, additionally, the development of an agreed definition for a ‘biodegradable FAD’."
WCPFC18,151,"Canada welcomed the recommendations put forward regarding biodegradable FADs and reduction in entangling material, and stated it looked forward to further involvement with the FADMO-IWG in the future. It voiced its full support for the report."
WCPFC18,152,"Cook Islands noted that the FADMO-IWG’s report stated that most CCMs are in favour of the recommendations, but that some questions remained regarding definitions and timelines, which were also under consideration in the tropical tuna measure discussions. Cook Islands stated it looked forward to constructive discussions on what could be included in the CMM, and to resolving the outstanding issues."
WCPFC18,153,"The EU supported the conclusions contained in the IWG report, and stated it would have preferred to move more rapidly on priority areas. The EU stated the hope the Commission could progress in 2022 on some issues that had addressed, especially adoption of full non-entangling FADs; it encouraged tasking the FADMO-IWG to actively progress the outstanding issues in 2022, including the issue of monitoring of FADs, which has not been addressed by the IWG to date."
WCPFC18,154,"French Polynesia thanked the FADMO-IWG for the work done to move towards biodegradable and non-entangling FADs, especially in the difficult context of online meetings, and acknowledged that it is a very important issue that needs to be addressed. French Polynesia stated it faces growing marine pollution due to abandoned and lost FADs, and that much needs to be done to have effective management of FADs in the Commission.  It advocated that a stronger management scheme for FADs be included in the future, covering better marking, monitoring, reporting, and tracking, as well as retrieval and recovery, whether it be under the framework of the tropical tuna measure or a specific FAD CMM, whichever is more suitable. French Polynesia looked forward to working collaboratively with other CCMs on that topic. French Polynesia noted that it is situated in the overlap area, and FADs drift from east to west, and encouraged comprehensive and collaborative work on the issues with IATTC."
WCPFC18,155,"The Commission noted the report and recommendations of the FAD Management Options IWG (WCPFC18-2021-FADMgmtOptions). The recommendations of the IWG were considered in the context of the Tropical Tuna Measure (see Agenda 7.2.2 above).  7.2.3 Other Commercial Fisheries for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin"
WCPFC18,156,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC18-2021-24. Indonesia and SPC. Options for a baseline of the “large-fish” Handline fishery fishing in Indonesia’s EEZ (IEEZ) with vessels >30GT for the WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure, which discusses work conducted on the application of paragraph 51 of CMM 2020-01 to Indonesia’s “Other Commercial” domestic fisheries. Indonesia noted the following relevant papers: SC17-2021-ST-WP02 An assessment of available information to address the WCPFC17 recommendation on the Tropical Tuna CMM para 51 (other commercial fisheries) and TCC17-2021-SC17 ST-IP-09 Availability of Catch Estimates from the Other Commercial Fisheries in Indonesia. It stated that TCC17 requested that Indonesia and SPC provide and present to WCPFC18 for consideration the annual catch estimates for the “large-fish” handline fishery in Indonesia fishing outside archipelagic waters and territorial sea for vessels >30GT, and options for a baseline (using the average of 2013-2016 or the maximum year, due to the absence of data for 2001-2004), with the goal of informing revision of paragraph 51. It noted that the paper invites WCPFC18 to review and consider the baseline of 12,682 mt (the maximum annual catch in the period 2013-2016) listed in Table 1 in the paper as the limit for the “large-fish” handline fishery in Indonesia under paragraph 51 of CMM 2020-01. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  35"
WCPFC18,157,"The USA referenced the discussion during TCC17, where it expressed some concern that WCPFC would base the limit on the 2013-2016 period solely because that is the only period for which reliable data are available. It suggested staying with the intent of the measure, which was to use a much earlier period. It noted that data is available back to 2000, and for dates up to 2012 catch estimates are available but combine the large fish handline with other gear. It inquired whether those figures (in Table A2 in SC17-2021/ST-IP-09) are limited or faulty (other than the fact they do not distinguish between the fisheries). Indonesia stated that improving the data collection was a long process, and that it is a very complex fishery. Regarding the differing baselines, as explained previously, and as SPC has indicated, a detailed breakdown, especially for the large fish handline fishery for 2001-2004, is not available. Indonesia stated that the data presented in WCPFC18-2021-24 were the only reliable data, and that it could try to address compatibility with 2001-2004 data. SPC noted that it had not performed a detailed review of Indonesia’s data prior to 2010, and was unable to address possible uncertainties or assess their reliability."
WCPFC18,158,"Japan stated that paragraph 51, requires that CCMs “not exceed either the average level for the period 2001-2004 or the level of 2004”, and inquired regarding the logic of using the maximum for 2015 and not the average over the period for 2013-2016. Indonesia stated that the options for choosing the baseline for 2013-2016 were to use the average or maximum catch, and that it preferred to use the highest catch during that period; it noted that the status of the fishery stocks during that period was satisfactory, making use of the maximum catch reasonable."
WCPFC18,159,"China stated that it is important to understand the situation of the “other commercial fisheries”, and inquired regarding the total number of fishing vessels over 30m that caught this total, and the composition of the catch in terms of skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye. It noted that the total catch in 2012 was about 2,600 mt, which by 2015 had increased to12,600 mt, and asked the reason for this? China acknowledged that data collection is very hard for small fisheries, and asked how data is reported (by vessel owners, port sampling etc)? Indonesia noted the improvements in data collection and reiterated its thanks for the WPEA project. It stated that in 2010 data collection was mainly based on the port sampling program under the WPEA, and it had about 6 landing sites. This expanded with cooperation from industry, NGOs and other stakeholders. Indonesia developed its harvest strategy in 2018 and expanded the coverage of port sampling sites to 23 landing sites (the figure is now higher). It stated the work is linked to Indonesia’s National Management Plan and harvest strategy work, and that Indonesia also collects data from observers, which involves its industry and NGOs. Data collection has improved since 2014 and 2015, and thus the current catch is more representative of the actual amount (the increase is the result of better data collection). Regarding the number of vessels over 30 m, for handline fisheries this is provided in the Annual Report Part 1; it is around 20 vessels, but not all are on the WCPFC RFV (Indonesia stated this would have to be confirmed)."
WCPFC18,160,"The EU thanked Indonesia and SPC for their efforts to progress this issue, noting the difficulties, and supported further work. The EU suggested it could be useful if the recommendations for the limits and reference periods could be brought together into a single document, and stated it was unclear what the catch totals would be in the context of the CMM. It inquired if a rough estimate was available regarding the share that would not be included under the heading commercial fisheries by focusing only on those fisheries for which data are available. Indonesia stated it could try and provide the requested information in a single document. It recalled the discussion in TCC17 of the difficulties in assessing these data, and stated that Indonesia’s understanding was the fisheries that fall under the tropical tuna measure are limited to the large fish handline fleet composed of vessels over 30 m. It stated that under its national law it could not assess the other fisheries. Indonesia stated that a response with respect to the pole and line fishery might require further collaboration. SPC stated that more information on the other commercial fisheries was available in WCPFC18-2021-IP04, Tables 8 and 9, which includes data for those that are not covered by CMM 2020-01. SPC stated that if further information was needed it could expand on the referenced tables in future years.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  36"
WCPFC18,161,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, noted and endorsed the recommendations from the SC17 and TCC17 relating to the application of paragraph 51 to both Indonesia and the Philippines. They thanked the two CCMs for working with SPC and providing the requested information for the tropical tuna measure and the Commission’s scientific work. They noted the concern expressed by other CCMs about the implication of selecting other baseline periods. FFA members stated that the information provided by Indonesia had not been considered by the SC and the TCC in the same way that the baselines for the other relevant fisheries covered by paragraph 51 had been. They stated they consider this review to be important, both for the purpose of ensuring due process, and also to ensure that the implications of the different baseline period can be considered. FFA members therefore recommended that SC18 and TCC18 review the recommended baseline period and provide advice to WCPFC19. They also noted they would need to consider the implications for the drafting of the new tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC18,162,"PNG stated its understanding that the bulk of the data concern fishing in archipelagic waters, and stated that Indonesia’s continued efforts in this regard were very much appreciated."
WCPFC18,163,The Commission noted the presentation by Indonesia of advice of SC17 and TCC17 on the implementation of paragraphs 50 and 51 of CMM 2020-01 with respect to the Indonesian “large-fish” handline fishery for vessels >30gt in Indonesia’s EEZ (WCPFC18-2021-24). The recommendations were considered in the context of the Tropical Tuna Measure (see Agenda 7.2.2 above).  7.3 South Pacific Albacore 7.3.1 Review of the interim target reference point
WCPFC18,164,"Dr. Graham Pilling (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-17 by SPC. Recalibration of the target reference point for South Pacific albacore and referenced WCPFC18-2021-18. Secretariat. Reference Document for South Pacific Albacore for the Review of CMM 2015-02 and Development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06. SPC noted that a new stock assessment was agreed by SC17 in 2021; SC17 also requested that SPC (i) recalibrate the TRP that would on average achieve the agreed goal of an 8% increase in vulnerable biomass (CPUE proxy) for the southern longline fishery as compared to 2013 levels and (ii) undertake projections to estimate the constant catch levels that would achieve that recalibrated TRP, on average, over the long-term. The general approach used was comparable to that used to recalibrate the skipjack interim TRP; in this case longline and troll fisheries were projected with their future catch level adjusted to achieve long-term WCPFC-CA longline vulnerable biomass levels specified under the TRP. SC17 requested two catch scenarios: one in which fishing levels within both the southern WCPFC-CA and the remainder of the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) were adjusted proportionally; and a second in which only fishing levels within the southern WCPFC-CA were adjusted, and with the remainder of the EPO fixed at recent catch levels."
WCPFC18,165,"To achieve the WCPFC-CA longline vulnerable biomass goal, the recalibrated southern WCPFC-CA albacore TRP depletion level is 68% SBF=0. At that average depletion level, there is a 1%-2% risk of falling below the LRP. This reflects the notable uncertainty within the South Pacific albacore assessment. The recalibrated TRP implies a less depleted stock; the 2021 assessment indicates less depleted recent historical levels, influenced by the SC17 model grid weighting. Approximate catch levels in longline and troll fisheries across the South Pacific, and within the WCPFC-CA specifically, that achieved the TRP varied according to the catch scenarios:   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  37    (i) Under South Pacific-wide management, total (longline + troll) catch levels equated to 49,200 mt. WCPFC-CA catch was 40,500 mt, with 8,700 mt in the remaining EPO assuming relative regional catch levels between regions remained at 2017-2019 levels. (ii) With management in the WCPFC-CA only (EPO catch remaining at 2017-2019 average levels), total (longline + troll) catch levels were just over 51,700 mt; of this 36,200 mt was in the WCPFC-CA, with 15,500 mt in the remaining EPO. The lower WCPFC-CA catch level reflects additional management action required to achieve the TRP if cross-Pacific management is not feasible. Actual total and WCPFC-CA catch levels would depend upon those that occur in the EPO.  The recalibrated TRP implied lower catch levels within the southern WCPFC-CA than under the 2018 assessment (which were approximately 46,700 mt in the southern WCPFC-CA). This is influenced by:  (i) The Pacific-wide nature of the 2021 stock assessment and the implications of fishing in the EPO component that was not previously considered; and  (ii) The different responsiveness of the 2021 assessment grid to changes in future catch.  What is consistent between the 2021 and 2018 assessments is that the interim TRP will not be achieved under recent catch levels in the southern WCPFC-CA. It is expected that future TRP-related catch levels will need to be adjusted in the face of increased knowledge of the South Pacific albacore stock. This will be supported through the adoption of a harvest strategy that can adapt dynamically to, for example, good or poor recruitment events, and be robust to the uncertainties inherent in the stock assessments."
WCPFC18,166,"In response to a query from Canada, SPC stated that the EPO in the modelling excludes the overlap area (that are being included in the WCPFC-CA figures). The longline and troll catch in the WCPFC-CA is dominated (about 95%) by longline catch. Details are provided in WCPFC18-2021-IP05."
WCPFC18,167,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA members fully supported the advice from SPC on investing more resources and time on improving the close-kin-mark-recapture (CKMR) work, which has proven to address the uncertainties of the stock biomass estimates. They noted that the presentation and paper constituted new information for the Commission to consider, but stated their immediate concern that the recalibrated TRP signals high South Pacific albacore catch cuts will be required to achieve the TRP, which would further threaten the survival of their domestic longline fishing industries; waiting will only worsen the situation. FFA members recommended referring the matter to the South Pacific Albacore IWG to consider appropriate actions in the workplan for 2022. In the meantime, and as indicated in WCPFC18-2021-DP04, they called for an immediate freeze of catch and effort for South Pacific albacore south of the equator on the high seas."
WCPFC18,168,"Indonesia noted the TRP for South Pacific albacore of 0.68 is high, and inquired what projections indicate would happen should the TRP not be achieved. SPC stated that the TRP is 68% of unfished levels based on the most recent stock assessment, which is higher than the previous TRP, but that this was needed to have the CPUE 8% above 2013 levels. There are uncertainties in stock movement that influence the results of the stock assessment that SPC hopes will be addressed through the CKMR work. Projections of stock status indicate a reduction under recent fishing conditions, with stock recovering and stabilizing over time but with CPUE not recovering to the point that managers have sought to achieve through the TRP."
WCPFC18,169,"New Caledonia observed that troll fisheries are perhaps 5% of catch, but that the South Pacific troll fishery targets small fish in southern parts of the WCPFC-CA, and inquired regarding the real impact of the troll fishery on the health of the stock. In response, SPC referred to an impact plot from the stock assessment for different gears, stating that it was correct that troll fisheries catch smaller fish around 60 cm that would otherwise grow into the adult population, but noted that the natural mortality of those fish is also high. SPC further emphasized that the major impact is through the longline fishery, and that the impact from troll fishery is fairly small, although not insignificant."
WCPFC18,170,"China thanked SPC for the stock assessment conducted in conjunction with IATTC, and inquired whether subsequent assessments would be conducted jointly, and whether any conservation measures would WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  38    be undertaken in both the EPO and WCPO. SPC stated that it worked with IATTC because this was a Pacific-wide stock assessment (previously SPC had not considered the EPO in conjunction with the WCPO). SPC stated it would cooperate with IATTC on any future Pacific-wide stock assessments. In terms of more stringent measures required in the WCPO, SPC analysed both the application of consistent conservation and management measures across the WCPO and EPO, and a second scenario where changes were made only by WCPFC in the WCPO and overlap area."
WCPFC18,171,The Commission noted the advice of the SC17 related to a recalibration of the interim TRP for the SP albacore.  7.3.2 Roadmap for effective conservation and management of SP albacore
WCPFC18,172,"Ms Neomai Ravitu (Fiji), Chair of the South Pacific Albacore-Roadmap-IWG (Fiji) provided a summary of the outcomes of the virtual meeting held in June 2021, as contained in WCPFC18-2021-South Pacific albacore-RM-IWG Chair’s Summary Report of the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG Meeting."
WCPFC18,173,"China suggested the need for additional consultations between members prior to SPA-IWG meetings to enable a more complete exchange of views in the IWG, and suggested the need for transparency with respect to the total allowable catch under existing (and planned) VDS or catch-based management regimes for CCMs’ EEZs. China suggested that the South Pacific albacore total allowable catch (TAC) in SIDS national jurisdictions was much higher than the current catch, which complicates developing an understanding of the situation in the albacore fishery. China indicated that it had provided these comments to the SPA-IWG. It also stated that while it sought to cooperate on management measures, but with the condition that the new CMM is comprehensive, and not limited to south of 20°S."
WCPFC18,174,"Niue on behalf of FFA members thanked the Chair of the SPA-IWG and stated as indicated in WCPFC18-2021-DP04, they urged the work of the SPA-IWG be prioritized for early 2022. Noting it is unfortunate that not much has progressed given the situation. FFA members voiced their commitment to the work and provided suggestions on revisions to the IWG Workplan: (i) the IWG should prioritise the setting of a TAC/total allowable effort (TAE) for the stock followed by an allocation framework for the Commission and the allocations of the limit for CCMs; and (ii) priority should be given to development of the harvest strategy for the South Pacific albacore fishery.  They noted the lack of movement on the work on trajectories and associated catch cuts and suggested the harvest strategy was essential for responding to the latest assessment results. They looked forward to working collaboratively with other CCMs in the SPA-IWG."
WCPFC18,175,"French Polynesia commented regarding Agenda items 7.3.1 and 7.3.2. They noted that because of their location in the overlap area they particularly appreciated the Pacific-wide analysis, and the work on recalibration of the TRP, they share the concern of other members about continuing declining catch rates.  They thanked the SPA-IWG for the work conducted under the difficult virtual meeting context in 2022. French Polynesia emphasised the importance of the South Pacific albacore fishery for its economy and food security, noting that South Pacific albacore is fished by its domestic longline fleet and local crew, only in its EEZ, and in a sustainable way validated by MSC certification. It stated that its EEZ is surrounded by a large high seas area, and that French Polynesia is increasingly worried about the level of catch and transhipments that occur in these international waters, and that it looked forward to this important issue being addressed by the Commission. It supported further scientific work to inform management, and a strong roadmap for the IWG for next year, to ensure progress can be made at WCPFC19, especially on harvest strategies matters for South Pacific albacore. It shared Niue’s (on behalf of FFA members) concern about the need for prioritisation of the work for the IWG, and stated it would be happy to work collaboratively with all CCMs on that topic. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  39"
WCPFC18,176,"Chinese Taipei supported management of the South Pacific albacore stock, and stated the need for collaborative effort. It stated that fishing and the related impact are in both the EEZs and high seas. It favoured keeping management measures in the area south of 20°S, and stated it would be favour additional discussions on any further measures, or extension of existing measures from 20°S to the equator."
WCPFC18,177,"New Zealand stated it remained committed to the work of the SPA-IWG to insure a more stable and economically viable fishery, and supported comments by FFA members. It emphasized the need to prioritise the harvest strategy work for 2022, and to maintain MSC certification, noting FFA members want to establish a TAC split between high seas and EEZs, and are working on establishing a zone-based management approach for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC18,178,"New Caledonia stated that South Pacific albacore is the main species targeted by its longline fisheries, and stated it shared priorities expressed by Niue."
WCPFC18,179,"The USA stated its support for giving priority to the work of the SPA-IWG in 2022, in particular the need to consider controls on fish mortality in areas of greatest mortality, in Regions 1 and 2 (N of 25°S). It stated that moving the stock toward the TRP is critical for livelihoods and food security."
WCPFC18,180,"The EU encouraged all CCMs to progress the South Pacific albacore work, which is an important stock for many CCMs. It announced that the EU would be making a voluntary contribution to the CKMR work for South Pacific albacore (pending approval by the Commission of the project as part of the budget for 2022), and stated it hoped this would help strengthen the scientific basis for the work."
WCPFC18,181,Canada echoed the concerns of other CCMs with respect to the declining trends in South Pacific albacore CPUE. It supported finding ways to extend controls over South Pacific albacore fishing activities on all areas south of the equator.
WCPFC18,182,"Japan also shared concerns over the South Pacific albacore stock. It stated it fully understands the FFA position regarding zone-based management, and would join work to develop effective management measures for the stock."
WCPFC18,183,The Commission noted the report of progress from the SP Albacore Roadmap Working Group (WCPFC18-2021-South Pacific albacore-RM-IWG).
WCPFC18,184,"The Commission noted the priorities for the SP albacore Roadmap IWG for 2022, in particular the development of a Harvest Strategy for SPA or SPA fisheries, the setting of a TAC and allocation, and encouraged CCMs to continue to work cooperatively in the IWG.  7.3.3 Review of CMM 2015-02"
WCPFC18,185,"The Chair noted that Samoa (under Agenda Item 7.3.1) indicated that FFA members called for an immediate freeze on South Pacific albacore catch levels south of the equator, and invited comments from CCMs."
WCPFC18,186,"New Caledonia stated it shared the FFA members’ concerns, as its longline fishery is strongly dependent on South Pacific albacore, which is important both economically and for food security. It stated it has developed a sustainable approach to management of fisheries in its EEZ, with fishing activity restricted to a small number of domestic vessels, with a historically low fishing effort. The stock assessment shows the South Pacific albacore stock is in a healthy condition, even though yield continues to decline, with the stock devolving towards an overfished situation. Decreasing yields and declining CPUE in Melanesia lead WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  40    New Caledonia to fear that without strong management measures, the conditions under the TRP will not be achieved. New Caledonia stated it is also very concerned about increased catch in high seas pocket 7, which has almost doubled during 2019-2020. It called for strong action to be taken to avoid further decline in the South Pacific albacore stock status, especially in the high seas in the southern part of the WCPFC-CA, and reiterated the need for more accurate data and specific analyses to be produced regarding high seas fishing activities to inform the decisions of the Commission."
WCPFC18,187,Samoa called for an immediate freeze on catches on the high seas south of the equator.
WCPFC18,188,"The USA stated it was open to considering a freeze on South Pacific albacore catch and effort that applied to the entire WCPFC-CA, not just the high seas, and that such a freeze would need to be binding for all members."
WCPFC18,189,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members stated they consider that CMM 2015-02 needs comprehensive revision to ensure that the fishery remains both sustainable and viable given its economic importance to the region. They also noted their strong concerns about the results of the latest SPC analyses on albacore, and stated that the current measure is ineffective for monitoring and controlling the fishery, and cannot be effectively enforced. Accordingly, FFA members stated they would seek to collaborate with all CCMs and the SPA-IWG in the development of a new measure for South Pacific albacore for 2022. They stated that the new CMM must recognise the zone-based management approach in the management of this fishery in CCMs’ zones and result in a genuine, material improvement in how the fishery is managed through WCPFC. They called on all CCMs fishing south of the equator for a commitment to maintain or reduce their effort and catch until the Commission has in place a revised CMM with effective management arrangements for this fishery and allocations of any catch or effort limits to both the high seas and EEZs."
WCPFC18,190,"China stated that regarding fishing effort, it indicated in 2012 it would control its effort to less than 400 vessels; since then it has had fewer than 400 vessels, and often significantly fewer. China stated that to control fishing effort a comprehensive CMM is needed that applies to the entire WCPO area. China stressed that a freeze could not apply to only the high seas, which China suggested would not be for the purpose of conservation, but for the benefit of select CCMs. China stated that FFA CCMs’ TAC in their EEZs totals over 100,000 mt/year, and that even with no effort on the high seas, this level of catch would cause South Pacific albacore to continue to decline. China noted that finding a solution for South Pacific albacore is a shared obligation, and that if any action was limited to the high seas, it could not agree to it. It also inquired how many of each CCM’s vessels fished for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC18,191,"Chinese Taipei stated this was a very important issue for its fleet. It supported the work of SPC, which it hoped can provide information to improve management. It supported extending the management area to include the area from the equator to 20°S, and stated that it seeks to maintain the current management system, and that CCMs should take efforts together to manage the stock."
WCPFC18,192,"Niue noted that a lot of the catch increases are occurring in the high seas, which is why FFA members sought a binding freeze on any increase in the high seas. It noted that FFA members have their own management measures, and their negotiations would continue."
WCPFC18,193,"China requested information from SPC on the distribution of South Pacific albacore catch in the WCPO high seas vs. EEZs. SPC referenced Table 1 of WCPFC18-2021-IP05. China noted that this indicated a downward trend in total catch, and that the high seas catch had not increased sharply. China stated that the figures did not support a decision to cap fishing effort only on the high seas, and that it couldn’t agree to such a cap.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  41"
WCPFC18,194,"CCMs consulted on steps that could help in addressing the situation while a new CMM is negotiated. In the course of their discussions, some CCMs supported the proposal, and some CCMs raised the following points: • South Pacific albacore is neither overfished or subject to overfishing, but achieving the interim TRP, adopted in 2018, would require that action be taken. The interim TRP is in the WCPFC15 report, and hence not a binding measure.  • Inclusion of reference years could be problematic for some CCMs. • A freeze on catch should be voluntary. • A freeze on effort should apply to all members for the entire Convention Area. • Attribution and record of catch on the high seas could complicate a mandatory provision."
WCPFC18,195,The Commission noted that the review of CMM 2015-02 Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific Albacore is ongoing as part of the work of the SP Albacore Roadmap IWG. The Commission encouraged the SPA Roadmap IWG to speed up its process and progress its recommendations.
WCPFC18,196,"The Commission noted concerns regarding the delayed process to implement an interim TRP adopted in 2018, and the need to take action to rebuild the stock to support the economic viability of fleets, and achieve a long-term TRP."
WCPFC18,197,"Given the urgency of these concerns, the Commission agreed that until a new CMM for South Pacific Albacore is adopted, each CCM is encouraged to take steps to implement interim controls on South Pacific albacore catch or effort across the convention area south of the equator.  i. CCMs are encouraged to limit commercial fishing of South Pacific albacore within EEZs to domestically applied catch or effort limits in recent years.   ii. Each CCM is encouraged to ensure that its flagged vessels for this species shall not exceed the high seas catch or effort (such as number of vessels) of South Pacific albacore by its flagged vessels in recent years."
WCPFC18,198,These interim arrangements do not confer the allocation of rights to any CCM and are without prejudice to any future decisions of the Commission.
WCPFC18,199,"These interim arrangements shall not prejudice the legitimate rights and obligations under international law for small island developing State and Participating Territory CCMs in the Convention Area for whom South Pacific albacore is an important component of the domestic tuna fishery in waters under their national jurisdiction, and who may wish to pursue a responsible level of development of their fisheries for South Pacific albacore in their EEZs or adjacent high seas.  7.4 Pacific bluefin  7.4.1 Review of CMM 2020-02"
WCPFC18,200,"The NC Chair introduced proposed revisions to CMM 2020-02, noting WCPFC18-2021-19. Secretariat. Reference Document for the review of CMM 2020-02 and development of harvest strategies (Pacific Bluefin Tuna) and Highlights from NC17 for Agenda 9.3. The NC Chair reviewed the stock status WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  42    of Pacific bluefin tuna, and indicated the initial rebuilding target had been achieved 2 years earlier than scheduled, and the second target was on track to be achieved earlier than expected. The NC recommended that the Commission adopt the revised CMM for Pacific Bluefin Tuna in Attachment D of the NC17 Summary Report (Attachment A to WCPFC18-2021-19) and the revised Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries in Attachment E of the NC17 Summary Report (Attachment B to WCPFC18-2021-19)."
WCPFC18,201,"Japan voiced strong support for revisions to the CMM as recommended by the NC chair. It stated that the proposed 15% catch increase for large fish was fully in accordance with the harvest strategy, and that it was very confident this would decrease the burden on small-scale fishermen, while achieving the conservation goals with respect to Pacific bluefin tuna. It reviewed the management measures implemented by WCPFC, noting that in 2017 a harvest strategy was adopted, with two rebuilding targets and harvest strategy rules. Japan stated it had complied with the management measures in order to rebuild the stock, which it stated was not an easy task, because a significant number of artisanal and small-scale fishermen fish for this species in Japan’s coastal waters. It stated that fishermen had made significant sacrifices to comply with the management measures. Japan noted that the probability of achieving the second rebuilding target was over 97%, and stated that adjusting the catch limit was important for promoting fishermen’s active involvement in further management. Japan also noted that Pacific bluefin tuna is highly migratory and is thus managed cooperatively with IATTC; the 15% increase was adopted by IATTC and will be in effect in 2022. Japan reiterated the importance of Pacific bluefin tuna for Japan, and stressed that this was Japan’s in-zone fishery, and that it would continue to exercise its responsibility for sustainable management and research with respect to the stock."
WCPFC18,202,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the proposed revised CMM would include an increase in catches for Pacific bluefin tuna. While they noted that an increase in catch is allowed under the recovery plan, it is by no means mandatory or automatic, especially when there is so much uncertainty in the assessment, and the spawning stock biomass is estimated to be an extremely low 4.5% of SBF=0, which is well below the LRP of 20%SBF=0 employed by the WCPFC for its main tuna stocks. FFA members stated they were therefore very concerned about the proposed increases in the review of the CMM and needed to give the proposal serious consideration."
WCPFC18,203,"Korea agreed with comments from Japan. It noted that extensive discussion had been held on the issue during July to October 2021, and that FFA members participated in the NC17 meeting. It stated its expectation was that the Commission would adopt the new CMM as the NC recommended."
WCPFC18,204,"The EU acknowledge the efforts of the CCMs involved and stated it was also concerned about the proposed increases, and that in spite of the positive biomass trends and the optimistic trends, the stock remained at very low levels, and the uncertainty regarding the stock status required a precautionary approach. The EU stated it would not oppose the recommendations, but stated the need to be very cautious until second rebuilding target is attained."
WCPFC18,205,"Chinese Taipei stated the Commission should follow the harvest strategy and best available scientific information available from ISC, which indicates the stock is recovering. It supported an increase in the catch limits, stating that this is a conservative approach."
WCPFC18,206,"RMI on behalf of PNA and Tokelau supported the work that had gone into the proposed CMM, which it acknowledged is consistent with the harvest strategy, but stated it was difficult to support the recommendations for catch increases, given that the spawning biomass is at a very low level and overfishing is continuing."
WCPFC18,207,"Niue stated it shared some concerns about the status of stock, but could support the proposal. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  43"
WCPFC18,208,"Solomon Islands on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated they were troubled by the inconsistency of being asked to support increased catches of a bluefin stock, which has been severely depleted, while the CCMs involved were holding up agreement on a revised skipjack TRP because they want to reduce effort for a very healthy and well-managed stock. They indicated as well their concern about the apparent inconsistency of banning retention of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks, for which there are similar conservation concerns to those of bluefin, and then being asked to support increasing catches of this severely depleted bluefin stock, and requested an explanation for these inconsistencies."
WCPFC18,209,The NC Chair indicated that IATTC decided on a 15% increase in the catch limit plus a 200 mt increase.
WCPFC18,210,"China stated it had no Pacific bluefin tuna specific-fisheries, and that it was appropriate for the NC to make this recommendation. It supported the proposal, and noted that the NC’s recommendation was based on Annex 1 of the rules of procedure, and that this was not automatically a Commission decision. China stated that if the proposal was contrary to the objectives of the Commission, it should be rejected; otherwise, it should be approved."
WCPFC18,211,"The Ocean Foundation noted that Pacific bluefin tuna was still overfished and experiencing overfishing, and stated that with this proposal WCPFC risked undermining the work that had already been done. It recommended that WCPFC makes its own choice based on the merits of the proposal, and advocated that WCPFC reject the recommendation from NC to increase the catch limits. It stated that instead of making progress developing a management strategy evaluation (MSE)-tested harvest strategy for this species, the NC had repeatedly debated increases to catch limits, despite a very depleted stock (below 5% of SBF=0), and stated that achievement of the rebuilding target should be confirmed through a stock assessment. It noted the lack of new advice from the NC, and the suggested caution by NC16, given the uncertainty in the stock assessment. It noted that when the low recruitment scenario was used in the projection analysis in 2018, there was only a 3% chance of achieving the rebuilding target, and stated that this scenario was not used in 2020 due to an ISC decision. The Ocean Foundation advocated that under Agenda Item 9.3, the Commission should ask the NC to make good on its commitment to develop an MSE for harvest strategy adoption by 2024, noting that this commitment had already been made by the NC, but with inadequate progress to date. It stated that the high value (billion dollar) Pacific bluefin tuna fishery deserved such a commitment."
WCPFC18,212,"Japan acknowledged that an increase in the harvest would slow the recovery slightly, and stated that despite the slight uncertainty inherent in all assessments, it was certain that the PBF stock would recover even with the increase."
WCPFC18,213,"RMI noted the comments by Solomon Islands and echoed their request for an explanation of the inconsistencies. RMI stated it understood the importance of the fishery to Japan, culturally and economically, and noted that these factors were equally applicable for other CCMs regarding species in their waters. It also registered its ongoing concern with the underlying science behind the proposal, noting that overfishing was ongoing, and the spawning biomass was less than 5%."
WCPFC18,214,"Japan stated that taking into account that the stock is on the way to recovery, and the uncertainty in the stock assessment, the proposed catch increase was conservative, and that if the stock declined under the increased catch, the catch would be reduced, in accordance with the harvest strategy."
WCPFC18,215,The Commission noted the presentation by the NC Chair on the stock status of the Pacific bluefin tuna.
WCPFC18,216,The Commission adopted CMM 2021-02 Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific Bluefin Tuna (Attachment H). WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  44    7.5 Southwest Pacific swordfish  7.5.1 Future projections as requested by WCPFC16
WCPFC18,217,"The Chair noted the SC17 advice and results of the future projections for Southwest Pacific swordfish as tasked by WCPFC16 (para 481, WCPFC16 Summary Report) and SC17 (para 69-71, SC17 Outcomes Document); SC17 noted that the current CMM (CMM 2009-03) does not contain provisions to limit total fishing mortality."
WCPFC18,218,"SPC presented WCPFC18-2021-20-rev1 Southwest Pacific Swordfish projections and referenced WCPFC18-2021-21. Secretariat.  Reference Document for the Review of CMM 2009-03 (Southwest Pacific swordfish). SPC stated that WCPFC18-2021-20-rev1 describes the results of stochastic stock projections for southwest Pacific Ocean swordfish, using the 2021 stock assessment (WCPFC-SC17-2021-SA-WP-04). The projections explore the outcomes of 8 different future fishing (catch- or effort-based) scenarios according to requests from WCPFC16 and SC17, as follows:  • “Status quo (SQ) catches”: this projection assumes recent (average 2016-2018) levels of fishing (catch) both north and south of 20°S. • +/- “SQ catches”: an additional limited number of projections which assume future catch scenarios across the region that are a fixed percentage above and below “status quo” and that result in a range of upward and downward long-term biomass trends. For this request SPC provided projections with a 20% decrease and increase on the status quo catch. • “SQ effort”: this projection assumes recent (average 2016-2018) levels of fishing effort both north and south of 20°S. • +/- “SQ effort”: projections under a 20% decrease and increase on the status quo effort. • “Fully caught limits”: this projection assumes recent (average 2016-2018) levels of fishing (catches) north of 20°S and CCM-nominated maximum total catch levels (paragraph 4 of CMM 2009-13) of fishing south of 20°S. • “Maximum catch”: this projection assumes peak (2011-2013) levels of fishing (catches) north of 20°S and CCM nominated maximum total catch levels (paragraph 4 CMM 2009-13) for fishing south of 20°S."
WCPFC18,219,"The results are presented in terms of the standard performance indicators and reference points used for tuna species by the WCPFC, although there are no formally agreed reference points for this swordfish stock. The results of the 30-year projections showed that of the 8 scenarios, the “Maximum catch” and “Fully caught” scenarios—which involved considerably higher catches than observed over the history of the fishery—often crashed the stock, and led to a high number of projections (54%-69%) declining to <20% SBF=0 by the terminal year. The 6 other catch and effort-based projections had lower impacts. The status quo scenarios maintained the stock at a similar, albeit slightly less depleted status, than at the beginning of the projection period, with low numbers of models (<10%) breaching the standard overfishing and overfished benchmarks for tuna species. The 20% increase and decrease in status quo catches and effort had a moderate impact on terminal stock status compared to status quo. The 20% increases led to a slightly more depleted stock status than the 2019 starting level, with 8%-22% of models breaching the benchmarks for overfishing or overfished status applied to tuna by the WCPFC."
WCPFC18,220,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members noted that the results of the 30-year projections showed that the two high-catch scenarios (i.e. ‘maximum catch’ and ‘fully caught’) produced the worst outcomes for stock status. Both catch scenarios led to the stock becoming considerably more depleted than at the start of the projection period, with a relatively high number of projections indicating the stock crashed after 10 years, underscoring the priority of the work that FFA members have advocated to develop a new swordfish CMM that would prevent these scenarios being realised. They encouraged all CCMs to work with Australia on the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  45    development of a new measure through 2022. In comparison, projections that maintained the status quo catch and effort levels tended to result in the stock being maintained at levels similar to or slightly less depleted than at the starting year of 2019, both at the 10-year and terminal year stage of the projections. FFA members noted that these status quo catch scenarios also had low associated risk of breaching the standard WCPFC tuna benchmarks for indicating overfishing and overfished status. FFA members stated that the projections were very useful in testing the likely state of the stock in the future under a range of potential catch scenarios and would be critical in informing the development of a future CMM that protects the ongoing sustainability of this stock."
WCPFC18,221,"China stated it would like to work with Australia on this issue, and noted it has no target fisheries for swordfish. It observed that its tropical tuna vessels have some bycatch, but stated that is addressed by total fishing effort through the tropical tuna measure. It noted that South Pacific albacore fisheries also have bycatch and suggested South Pacific albacore and swordfish measures should be developed in parallel to find a better approach to manage these stocks."
WCPFC18,222,"The EU stated that until the Commission decided otherwise it would be more appropriate to present SBMSY and not only 20%SBF=0. It also noted that given that stock is assessed regularly, the 30-year projection result may not be the most useful, and that 10-year projections may provide a more valuable indication of stock status. The EU stated that the latest stock assessment indicates the stock is in good condition; the results seem more optimistic than previously but with more uncertainty, which may be related to the new approach to uncertainty, which was first applied for this stock. The EU suggested asking the SC to examine the issues regarding uncertainty with the aim of producing even better results for the next assessment."
WCPFC18,223,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC of the results of future projections for Southwest Pacific swordfish.  7.5.2 Review of CMM 2009-03
WCPFC18,224,"Australia noted WCPFC18-2021-DP08, which it introduced under Agenda Item 4. It thanked SPC for the recent stock assessment, and stated that while it was encouraged by the healthy status and lack of risk status associated with the status quo, the fully caught and maximum levels presented by SPC in WCPFC18-2021-20-rev1 did present a significant risk. It stated that the current measure for Southwest Pacific swordfish (CMM 2009-03) contains no restrictions on fishing mortality in the high seas area north of 20°S and contains flag-based limits south of 20°S that may be too high to prevent future overfishing. Consequently, it lacks the overall provisions required to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the stock and does not protect either the future fishery development opportunities for SIDS nor the economic viability of current swordfish-targeting fisheries, or fisheries for which swordfish is an important economic bycatch. Australia also stressed that a strong CMM could also ensure there is no future collateral damage to other fisheries, which may occur if the stock is overfished. Australia stated it had committed to developing a new CMM at WCPFC19, and referenced a number of papers prepared for SC17 regarding Southwest Pacific swordfish. It stated that a key feature of the revised draft CMM is that as a result of the healthy status of the stock, it does not seek to reduce fishery catches, but rather, focusses on preventing future increases in catches that could result in overfishing, impact future SIDS fishery development opportunities, and/or impact the economic viability of existing fisheries targeting this species. Australia stated it hoped to progress in drafting the new CMM over the next 12 months, encouraged comments through the ODF, and looked forward to discussions at TCC18 and SC18."
WCPFC18,225,"French Polynesia stated that although CMM 2009-03 contains some management measures intended to limit expansion of fishing on swordfish, it does not contain all the elements of a harvest strategy, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  46    including a harvest control rule. It stated that these elements are not only necessary to make sure the Commission’s future management is strong enough to ensure the sustainability of the overall fishery in the region, but are also important for French Polynesia to maintain its MSC certification, which was granted in 2021. French Polynesia stated the work undertaken by Australia will strengthen the CMM and contains a good basis for the Commission’s work on harvest strategies for Southwest Pacific swordfish, and looked forward to working collaboratively with other CCMs on future drafts."
WCPFC18,226,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, noted stock projections for Southwest Pacific swordfish that maintain the status quo catch and effort levels have a low associated risk of breaching the standard WCPFC tuna benchmarks indicating overfishing and overfished status, both at the 10 year and terminal year stage of the projections. However, they stated that under the two high-catch scenarios the stock became considerably more depleted (to 10%-18% of unfished spawning biomass levels after 30 years), with a relatively high number of projections that resulted in the stock crashing after only 10 years. They stated that such stock projection findings are a concern, given that SC17 noted that the current measure (CMM 2009-03) for Southwest Pacific swordfish does not contain provisions to limit total fishing mortality on the stock. FFA members stated that the largest sources of fishing mortality for this fishery can be attributed to distant water fishing fleets either targeting or taking swordfish as bycatch on the high seas, and that unless the catch of these fleets and others that significantly contribute to the fishing mortality of the Southwest Pacific swordfish stock can be controlled, it puts at risk the ongoing future sustainability of the stock, future fishery development opportunities for SIDS, and ongoing economic viability of current FFA fisheries targeting this stock. FFA members stated they therefore support WCPFC developing a revised and strengthened CMM that will ensure the ongoing future sustainability of Southwest Pacific swordfish, as emphasised by SC17 (paragraph 226, SC17 Summary Report), and encouraged CCMs to provide feedback on Australia’s draft CMM via the ODF at WCPFC18. FFA members also supported the recommendations made by the authors of the 2021 stock assessment, which include studies to better understand movement patterns and an expansion of minimum reporting requirements for longline operational characteristics, to mitigate against the uncertainties in the stock assessment."
WCPFC18,227,"Cook Islands stated it wanted to take a forward-looking approach and prevent future sustainability issues, and looked forward to working with other CCMs on the issue."
WCPFC18,228,The EU stated it would work with Australia intersessionally to improve the existing CMM.
WCPFC18,229,The Commission noted the work led by Australia to strengthen CMM 2009-03 on Southwest Pacific swordfish.  7.6 North Pacific Striped Marlin 7.6.1 Advice from the ISC
WCPFC18,230,The Chair advised that the Secretariat prepared WCPFC18-2021-22. Reference Document for North Pacific Striped Marlin for the Review of CMM 2010-01 to assist CCMs.
WCPFC18,231,"Dr. John Holmes, ISC Chair, reviewed the stock status and conservation information from the 2019 North Pacific striped marlin stock assessment. He noted that there are no established reference points for the stock, but that the stock status is consistent with it being overfished, with overfishing occurring, relative to MSY reference points. He noted that NC15 asked the ISC for recommendations on the appropriate recruitment scenario for North Pacific Ocean striped marlin stock projections. The ISC recommended the short-term recruitment model was the most appropriate model to use. If the stock continues to experience recruitment consistent with the short-term recruitment scenario (2012 - 2016), then catches must be reduced WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  47    to 60% of the WCPFC catch quota from CMM 2010-01 (i.e., from 3,397 mt to 1,359 mt) in order to achieve a 60% probability of rebuilding to 20%SB0 = 3,610 t by 2022. This change in catch corresponds to a reduction of roughly 37% from the recent average yield of 2,151 mt."
WCPFC18,232,"WCPFC17 asked ISC to look at several issues: (i) Examine differences between ISC stock assessment catch estimates by CCM and WCPFC catch estimates, and work with the Scientific Services Provider to provide an assessment of the shortcomings. The Billfish Working Group (ISC BILLWG), which includes members from SPC, discussed this question at a workshop in early 2021 in the context of a retrospective review of the quality of Japanese catch statistics (Working Paper ISC/21/BILLWG-01/05). The differences in catch estimates between the ISC stock assessment and the WCPFC occurs for longline fisheries that record the catch in numbers, and result from the different methods used to convert numbers to biomass for the WCPFC catch estimates and for the stock assessment. The BILLWG concluded that WCPFC Japanese longline fishery statistics and the output from stock synthesis are similar. (ii) Explain why the striped marlin stock decreased and the fishing mortality increased after a drastic decrease in fishing effort by high seas driftnet fisheries in the early 1990s. The BILLWG identified three potential contributing factors: (1) The model assumes that selectivity for Japanese driftnet catches during 1975-1993 is the same selectivity as in the Japanese coastal driftnet fishery during 1994-2017, although there is an assumed shift from catching large adults to small juveniles, which would result in an increase in fishing mortality even if the overall catch decreased; (2) The CPUE time series has a break in 1993-1994, which could be driving a shift in the model results due to a lack of continuity; and (3) the Japanese logbook data also changed their reporting requirements in 1993 to 1994, which could  contribute to the shift in fishing mortality, but not all CCMs agreed that this would drive the  change in fishing mortality. The ISC BILLWG agreed to estimate the initial equilibrium catch in the stock assessment model, and agreed that differences due to starting year were likely driven by the uncertainty in catches before 1993. (iii) Develop a roadmap to address the issues identified in the latest stock assessment by ISC. The ISC BILLWG recommended revising its work plan to assess the stock in 2022 and postpone the stock assessment to 2023 to address the concerns identified by the questions above, and by the BILLWG in its stock assessment report (ISC/19/ANNEX/11). For example, there were concerns about providing a rebuilding plan in 2021 and then reassessing the stock in 2022. However, the proposed revised workplan would permit updating of the rebuilding plan after the stock assessment in 2022."
WCPFC18,233,"RMI on behalf of FFA members noted that the North Pacific striped marlin stock remains overfished and is currently undergoing overfishing, but that this issue was not discussed by NC17.  FFA members supported the recommendation made by the ISC BILLWG to revise its work plan to assess the North Pacific Ocean striped marlin stock in 2022, rather than in 2023 as originally scheduled. The proposed revised work plan will mean that the latest data and information from the stock assessment can be used to inform the rebuilding plan for striped marlin in the North Pacific. In addition, FFA members stated there should be agreement on the LRP, and that this should be taken up by the Commission in 2022 when developing LRPs for non-target species, as noted at SC17. It stated the urgency for the Commission to agree on measures to reduce fishing mortality, and called on the CCMs exploiting this fishery to take a lead in reducing fishing mortality and exercising restraint in targeting striped marlin in the North Pacific."
WCPFC18,234,"The EU agreed with RMI, and stated it had expressed ongoing concern for this stock, which has had a poor conservation status since about 2011. It acknowledged uncertainties and data conflicts, and stated the need to make progress on analysis and management. It supported the recommendation to modify the stock WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  48    assessment schedule, noting that using the most up-to-date information would hopefully allow that adoption of an effective rebuilding plan."
WCPFC18,235,The Commission noted the presentation by ISC which responded to the request made by the Commission at WCPFC17.
WCPFC18,236,The Commission noted that the ISC would undertake a stock assessment of North Pacific striped marlin in 2022 and that the proposed revised workplan would permit updating of the rebuilding plan using the latest data from the stock assessment. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  7.6.2 Review of CMM 2010-01 and an Interim Rebuilding Plan
WCPFC18,237,"The USA stated that at WCPFC16 the Commission adopted a rebuilding plan for North Pacific striped marlin, and while noting that this was a step in the right direction, the USA stated that further action was required to ensure the stock is able to rebuild within the parameters agreed to. In 2020 the USA submitted a consultative draft proposal, and stated its intent to submit a new proposal in 2022 following completion by ISC of a new stock assessment. It noted that the stock remains very depleted, and stated that the Commission needs to take action to revise CMM 2010-01 to ensure the rebuilding plan is met. The USA stated its understanding regarding a query from the ISC regarding what the rebuilding target should be, and sought to clarify that the rebuilding plan should be based on a dynamic spawning stock biomass. The USA noted that a 2019 study co-authored by ISC BILLWG members found that the stock recruitment dynamics for striped marlin were nonstationary, thus supporting the use of a dynamic SSB. It noted that the appropriate timeframe for calculating the dynamic SSB could be derived by conducting a change point analysis on the recruitment time series to identify the appropriate window, or by scaling the time frame by generating mean time differences between tuna and striped marlin. The USA stated it believed that this would result in a timeframe covering the most recent 15 to 20 years because striped marlin have a longer lifespan than tuna, and would welcome the ISC deriving the appropriate timeframe by applying either of these methods. The USA proposed the following text be adopted by WCPFC18. WCPFC18 agrees that the rebuilding target for WCNPO striped marlin shall be based off the dynamic SSB0 and requests the ISC to derive the appropriate time frame for calculating the dynamic SSB0 by conducting a change point analysis on the recruitment time series to identify the appropriate time window, scaling the time frame based on the relative difference in mean generation times between tunas and striped marlin, or another appropriate methodology."
WCPFC18,238,Japan and Chinese Taipei expressed support for the language proposed by the USA.
WCPFC18,239,"Solomon Islands on behalf of FFA members noted with concern the dire status of the stock in the North Pacific, and stated urgent action is required to halt the decline of this stock and to rebuild it. They stated FFA members are of the view that any management and rebuilding plan for striped marlin in the North Pacific should take into account zone-based management, and indicated they would not support flag-based limits that cover the EEZs, especially if they are based on flag-based catch history in their waters; furthermore, they stated that any rebuilding plan should not limit SIDS’ access to the high seas as per Article 30 of the Convention and Article 25 of the UNFSA. They stated that setting of appropriate LRPs and catch limits would be an important part of the rebuilding plan. FFA members stated that in addition, an effective longline monitoring regime is required for the high seas to be able to monitor flag-based catches, and that until that is in place, it would be difficult to enforce any revised CMM, no matter how good it is on paper. They stated that robust monitoring would include electronic monitoring, a catch documentation scheme with independent verification in place, and robust port inspections and transhipment monitoring regimes.  49"
WCPFC18,240,"RMI, on behalf of PNA and Tokelau stated that the current management arrangement for this stock was not working and needed to be replaced with zone-based management arrangements that include effective monitoring and verification for any catch limits, which will take time. In the meantime, given the urgent need for stronger measures to reduce fishing mortality, they urged the Commission to look at alternative measures to remove targeting of striped marlin in the North Pacific, such as non-retention. They noted this should be an obvious option because that is what the Commission has put in place for oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks to address similar conservation concerns with those stocks. They stated that there appeared to be no other feasible effective management options for this stock at this point. PNA and Tokelau stated that non-retention across the longline and purse seine fisheries is likely to be necessary for rebuilding this stock."
WCPFC18,241,The Commission noted the concerning stock status of North Pacific striped marlin.
WCPFC18,242,The Commission noted that the USA intends to present a proposed revised CMM 2010-01 in 2022.
WCPFC18,243,"The Commission agrees that the rebuilding target for North Pacific striped marlin shall be based off the dynamic SSB0 and requests the ISC to derive the appropriate time frame for calculating the dynamic SSB0 by conducting a change point analysis on the recruitment time series to identify the appropriate time window, scaling the time frame based on the relative difference in mean generation times between tunas and striped marlin, or another appropriate methodology.   AGENDA ITEM 8  — HARVEST STRATEGY 8.1 Review of Indicative Work Plan"
WCPFC18,244,"The Chair noted that the Commission is required to review and update the Indicative Harvest Strategy Work Plan under CMM 2014-06 for 2021 and thereafter. The Chair noted the Secretariat’s reference document (WCPFC18-2021-23-rev1 Reference Document on the progress of the Harvest Strategy Workplan under CMM 2014-06) and WCPFC18-2021-DP05 Draft proposed amendments for the consideration of WCPFC18 to indicative work plan for the adoption of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (prepared by Australia) as reference papers, and noted the work done by Australia to coordinate updates to the harvest strategy work plan (HSWP) and the expectation that these would continue through the WCPFC18 meeting."
WCPFC18,245,"Mr. James Larcombe (Australia) noted that the HSWP in WCPFC18-2021-DP-05 was extended for 2 years, to 2024. He stated that adoption of management procedures for South Pacific albacore and skipjack remained scheduled for 2022, while yellowfin and bigeye management procedures were moved to 2024. For all species, SC is to formally agree on the operating models to be used for the MSE. He noted the plan was developed with assistance of SPC, and that although it was achievable technically, whether it could be achieved by CCMs through the Commission’s procedures and schedule, was a matter for discussion."
WCPFC18,246,"Solomon Islands on behalf of FFA members fully supported the revised HSWP, and noted that more time would be required to complete the ambitious and complex tasks to develop harvest strategies across all four key tuna stocks. FFA members voiced their commitment to the successful implementation of the indicative HSWP, and fully supported the revised plan and its extension for two years, ending in 2024.  They recognised that the HSWP continues to be ambitious and stated their strong desire to make significant progress on harvest strategy matters during 2022 and subsequently. They stated they were very encouraged by the inclusion of continued development of the multispecies framework in the plan, and noted that the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  50    Commission had been scheduled to agree on TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin tuna at WCPFC18. However, as stated under agenda item 7.2.1.2, given the ongoing impacts of COVID on the business of the Commission, and the major time and effort given to renegotiating the new tropical tuna measure , the Commission was unable to devote the time and energy needed to properly consider these decisions. FFA members stated they continued to encourage capacity-building initiatives to assist CCMs, particularly SIDS, to participate fully in the complex process, and build confidence in the harvest strategy development process and its outcomes when implemented. Noting the increasing number of issues that require the attention of, and feedback from, managers in order to progress the HSWP, FFA members supported the recommendation made by SC17 for a science-management dialogue to be convened in 2022."
WCPFC18,247,"The EU voiced its supports for the work and the future developments under the plan. The EU inquired regarding inclusion of a refined set of management procedures for skipjack, which was to have taken place in 2021, and stated this should still be reflected in the plan. It also noted the need to hold the science-management dialogue in order to progress the work contained in the HSWP. The EU also agreed with FFA regarding the need for capacity building, and noted that this need applied to all CCMs. It inquired whether recorded material from SPC was available, given the number of workshops that were being held in a virtual format, and noted that provision of assistance for all CCMs could help in progressing harvest strategy work. Regarding capacity building, SPC noted that SC17-MI-IP-02 details the stakeholder activities done so far and contained website links. The Science Manager indicated that the Commission’s Harvest Strategy web page was recently updated with the most recent documents and website links."
WCPFC18,248,"Australia stated that while scientific and technical work were proceeding apace and keeping up with ambitions, COVID and other aspects had led to a delay in the Commission’s ability to make significant progress in this complex area. Australia noted a detailed discussion on candidate management procedures (MPs) for skipjack and South Pacific albacore were to have taken place in 2021. It acknowledged that to schedule those matters to be discussed early in 2022 with a decision made by WCPFC19 was ambitious, given that it is important to have a number of cycles of consideration of candidate MPs, with consideration by SC, and the Commission. Australia acknowledged it might be advisable to defer adoption of MPs for skipjack and South Pacific albacore to 2023."
WCPFC18,249,"French Polynesia emphasized that exceptional circumstances should not stand in the way of progress, and agreed that the science-management dialogue be convened in 2022, given the work needed on South Pacific albacore and other species. French Polynesia stated it was flexible regarding the date as long as it was scheduled to inform WCPFC19’s decisions."
WCPFC18,250,PNG voiced support for a science-management dialogue.
WCPFC18,251,"Indonesia echoed the concern from other CCMs regarding the need for a science-management dialogue to help CCMs understand the harvest strategy development process and how to develop management measures. It voiced concern that some CCMs would be left behind in terms of the process, and noted that while documents and presentations were available online its preference was to be directly involved. Indonesia also indicated its interest in the development of harvest strategies for Indonesia’s archipelagic waters, and looked forward to additional dialogue with SPC regarding this. It also inquired regarding how multispecies and multigear work were addressed in the HSWP."
WCPFC18,252,"Australia acknowledged the difficulties in timing work on the various stocks, and indicated that the intent was to stagger the work on skipjack and yellowfin, while noting the relationships between an MP for skipjack and a stock outcome for bigeye, and that the multispecies framework tries to capture some of the relationships and catch outcomes across all those species. Australia stated that WCPFC18-2021-23-rev1 references the need to circle back and look at outcomes for bigeye in the skipjack process. SPC stated that the staggered approach was set up to make the process technically feasible, as SPC cannot address all four WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  51    stocks at same time; South Pacific albacore and skipjack are primarily fished by a single gear, which simplifies the process. SPC stated that SC has talked about the multispecies aspects in the WCPO; the intent is that the MP’s impact on other species can be addressed. SPC noted the HSWP updates noted the issue of checking the multispecies aspects of a management procedure in subsequent years."
WCPFC18,253,"RMI stated that a science-management dialogue would have to take place after SC so that all information could be considered, and noted that a skipjack stock assessment would be prepared in 2022, which would enable a TRP to be considered. Japan stated its understanding was the same regarding the skipjack TRP, and stated it was very hopeful that a harvest strategy for skipjack could be adopted in 2022."
WCPFC18,254,"Following further discussion CCMs agreed to minor modifications to the HSWP, with the understanding that the workplan would be revaluated and adjusted as needed during the 2022 science-management dialogue (discussed in detail under Agenda Item 8.2)."
WCPFC18,255,The Commission noted the presentation by Australia on Updates to the Indicative Harvest Strategy Work Plan (WCPFC18-2021-DP05).
WCPFC18,256,The Commission adopted the updated Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment I).
WCPFC18,257,The Commission noted that a re-evaluation and further discussion of the Indicative Workplan would take place during the Science-Management Dialogue scheduled for 2022.  8.2 Science-Management Dialogue
WCPFC18,258,"The Chair noted that discussions under Agenda Item 8.1 indicated strong support for a science-management dialogue, and invited further discussion regarding the details."
WCPFC18,259,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, welcomed the recommendations from SC to have a science-management dialogue in 2022, noting that this could be viewed as a trial to see whether it is the most effective way to discuss and develop the required harvest strategy recommendations for the Commission. They proposed it be held as part of or adjacent to SC18, with the following focus: • General capacity building to support confident and full participation of all CCMs in decision making on harvest strategies. • The current state of skipjack and South Pacific albacore management strategy evaluation frameworks and candidate management procedures.  • Update and capacity building on the mixed fishery (multispecies) approach. • Two items from SC17 MI-WP-03: o the definition of fisheries and fishery controls within the harvest strategy; o procedures for identifying, selecting and implementing the ’best performing’ management procedure. • Determining how Commission decision-making can best be supported by the SC and the Scientific Services Provider. Developing a ‘pathway’ for supporting decision making on management procedures that fulfills the information and training needs for making informed decisions that balance different management objectives. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  52    • Planning issues, including: Schedule and focus for future dialogue meetings; Updates to the Harvest Strategy Workplan; Discuss alignment of parallel processes (e.g. allocation) required to support implementation of harvest strategies."
WCPFC18,260,"China thanked FFA members for the proposal, and generally concurred with the content and timing. It noted the need to establish trust between scientists and tropical tuna managers. China recommended that there be a focus on general capacity building, and background on how SC recommendations are put forward and how uncertainty is addressed, with the goal of helping industry participants to understand these issues."
WCPFC18,261,"PNG stated they were planning a meeting early in 2022 with industry and would invite SPC and the Secretariat to participate. PNG indicated the PNA and Tokelau’s support for a science-management dialogue to be conducted in 2022 on a trial basis as part of a program to prioritise harvest strategies, and recognizing the limitations imposed by COVID-19. They strongly asserted that WCPFC needs to prioritise harvest strategies in 2022, and to be ready to engage in multiple discussions."
WCPFC18,262,"New Zealand thanked Australia for its work on the Harvest Strategy Workplan and indicated it is fully committed to implementing the workplan.  It noted SC17 had sought advice from WCPFC18 on a number of issues related to the harvest strategy, but that members are not able to make decisions without more detailed discussions in a dedicated forum such as a science-management dialogue. It agreed that it would be appropriate to hold the dialogue after SC18, and stressed the importance of also ensuring that more time is dedicated at the Commission to addressing harvest strategy issues."
WCPFC18,263,"The EU supported holding the science-management dialogue in 2022. In addition to the issues raised by FFA members the EU suggested the dialogue should also consider the specific tasks in the HSWP scheduled for consideration in 2022. It noted the timing of the meeting was more flexible if the meeting was held virtually, and suggested possibly holding two meetings (one in April or May 2022 and a second in conjunction with SC)."
WCPFC18,264,French Polynesia concurred that the harvest strategy work is very important and needs to be given priority that at the Commission’s annual meeting. It suggested CCMs consider holding several dialogue sessions in 2022 and subsequent years.
WCPFC18,265,RMI supported the FFA position and comments by PNG. It supported holding the dialogue in conjunction with SC as this would allow SPC time afterward to prepare for the Commission meeting.
WCPFC18,266,"Australia commented that the science-management dialogue could address the tasks outlined in the HSWP, and noted the need to think about how to structure the dialogue to progress the discussions. It noted the SC needed to agree to operating models for the tuna stocks, which is a new element for SC, and the benefit of holding the dialogue after SC would be that it could provide greater confidence to the discussions, and the dialogue would benefit from presentations and new information on MPs."
WCPFC18,267,"SPC stated it was flexible as to the timing, but that there was merit in holding the science-management dialogue directly after SC, as it would allow SC to discuss new developments, and introduce these to managers through the dialogue; it would also allow time for further work before the Commission meeting."
WCPFC18,268,"Indonesia supported the proposed areas of focus for the science-management dialogue. It expressed concern that sufficient time was needed to enable all CCMs to understand the process. It noted that effectively involving fisheries managers meant including higher-level of officials in the process, which could be challenging, given the general nature of the proposals and focus. Indonesia commented that more clarity was needed on uncertainty in the operating models, which are something of a “black box”. Indonesia WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  53    also expressed its interest in understanding how to translate outcomes for harvest strategy work in their archipelagic waters."
WCPFC18,269,"The EU inquired about an appropriate length for the science-management dialogue. In response SPC indicated that the original plan for the science-management dialogue called for 2 days, and that if held in conjunction with SC, a 2-day meeting would be a realistic initial start to the dialogue process."
WCPFC18,270,The Commission noted the importance and need for a Science-Management Dialogue to expedite the progress of implementation on the Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies.
WCPFC18,271,"The Commission agreed to have the first Science-Management Dialogue, on a trial basis, back-to-back with SC18 in 2022."
WCPFC18,272,"The Commission supported the following proposed areas of focus for the first Science-Management Dialogue, noting that the drafting the agenda would take into account views of CCMs on the focus of the science-management dialogue: (i) General capacity building to support confident and full participation of all CCMs in decision making on harvest strategies. (ii) The current state of skipjack and South Pacific albacore management strategy evaluation frameworks and candidate management procedures.  (iii) Update and capacity building on the mixed fishery (multispecies) approach. (iv) Two items from SC17 MI-WP-03 which are:  • the definition of fisheries and fishery controls within the harvest strategy; • procedures for identifying, selecting and implementing the ’best performing’ management procedure. (v) Determining how Commission decision-making can best be supported by the SC and the Scientific Services Provider. Developing a ‘pathway’ for supporting decision making on management procedures that fulfills the information and training needs for making informed decisions that balance different management objectives. (vi) Planning issues, including: Schedule and focus for future dialogue meetings; Updates to the Harvest Strategy Workplan; Discuss alignment of parallel processes (e.g., allocation) required to support implementation of harvest strategies.   AGENDA ITEM 9  —REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES AND WORKING GROUPS"
WCPFC18,273,"The Chair noted that reports of the Commission’s subsidiary bodies were taken as read, but that recommendations of subsidiary bodies not addressed under other agenda items would be considered under this agenda item.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  54    9.1 SC17"
WCPFC18,274,The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC18-2021-SC17: SC17 Summary Report.
WCPFC18,275,"The EU supported adoption of the SC17 report and its associated recommendations. It also recalled the extensive discussion at SC17 on the characterization of uncertainty in stock assessments. It noted as an example that a new approach was used to characterize uncertainty for South Pacific swordfish, which included an ad hoc filtering of model runs, the use of multinomial priors and the inclusion of statistical uncertainty. In the case of the southwest Pacific blue shark, the model grid was not adopted due to issues on the selection of models. The EU noted that the evaluation of risks of falling below LRPs is an essential element in the harvest strategy approach and it is obviously linked to how uncertainty is considered. It stated the importance of seeking consistency in the characterization of uncertainty and of conducting it in the same manner for all key WCPFC stocks. The EU recommended the Commission seek confirmation and advice from the SC on the best approach to be used for characterising uncertainty of stock assessments for key WCPFC stocks and their possible implications, including in terms of reducing uncertainty in management advice."
WCPFC18,276,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members supported adoption of the SC17 report and its recommendations."
WCPFC18,277,The Commission adopted the SC17 Summary Report (WCPFC18-2021-SC17).  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  9.2 TCC17
WCPFC18,278,"The Chair referenced WCPFC18-2021-TCC17: TCC17 Summary Report, WCPFC18-2021-25 Reference paper on TCC17 Recommendations for Agenda Items 9.2 and 9.4, and WCPFC18-2021-26 Draft Best Practice Guidelines for Handling of Cetaceans (the latter was introduced under Agenda Item 4)."
WCPFC18,279,CCMs supported adoption of the TCC17 report and its recommendations.  Commission VMS Issue 1 Disparity between CCM-held and Secretariat-held VMS data
WCPFC18,280,"The Commission noted that there continues to be a disparity between CCM-held and Secretariat-held VMS data, and tasked TCC18 to further consider future work to enable direct/simultaneous VMS reporting by vessels/ALCs reporting to the WCPFC VMS."
WCPFC18,281,"The Commission supported TCC17s’ recommendation and encouraged any CCMs capable of utilising a direct/simultaneous reporting framework to consider doing so on a voluntary basis. Any such CCMs are requested to report their experiences to TCC in the future, particularly any information regarding changes in the number of discrepancies between CCM-held and Secretariat-held VMS data. Issue 2 Data gaps from VMS failure"
WCPFC18,282,"The Commission supported the Secretariat’s continued work within their existing budget to address data gaps from VMS failure, including with interested CCMs on a trial basis**, to facilitate automatic integration of VMS manual reports into the Commission VMS. The Commission tasked the Secretariat to report on their further progress to TCC18. 55    ** Footnote: Ensuring that any VMS manual reports automatically integrated into the Commission VMS are clearly identifiable as manually generated reports, and can be distinguished from non-manually generated VMS positions."
WCPFC18,283,"The Commission tasked TCC18 to consider potential incentives for non-binding measures, including ‘VMS best practices’ that CCMs may adopt to minimise data gaps from VMS failures."
WCPFC18,284,"The Commission approved the extension of the WCPFC9 adopted amendments to the VMS Standards, Specifications and Procedures (SSPs) that were previously extended (via attachment 1 of the SSPs) at WCPFC11, WCPFC13 & WCPFC15, through 1 March 2024, and that this remains in force thereafter unless the Commission directs otherwise (Attachment J).  Issue 3 CCMs’ use of the VMS Reporting Status Tool (VRST)"
WCPFC18,285,The Commission adopted the updated VMS Standard Operating Procedures which incorporate recent changes in technology and technical processes and that are expected to benefit (and reflect) other VMS technical work undertaken by the Secretariat and VMS SWG to address VMS data gaps (Attachment L).   Issue 4 ALC/MTU approval
WCPFC18,286,"The Commission noted TCC17s’ advice that the updated VMS Standard Operating Procedures (Attachment L) include details on  i. the standard processes used to assess the ability of an MTU/ALC and its communication / satellite service provider / gateway to successfully report to the Commission VMS.   ii. how the VMS Manager will work with relevant vendors and CCMs to assess proposals for inclusion of additional MTU/ALC units and their communication / satellite service provider / gateway, against the new MTU/ALC type approval checklist; and iii. how the Secretariat shall provide this information to CCMs, along with any other documentation provided by the flag CCM or vendor, to better inform their consideration of any units proposed for listing or delisting. Issue 5 Assessing compliance with CMM 2014-02 paragraph 9(a) VMS SSP 2.8"
WCPFC18,287,"The Commission noted the issue of assessing compliance with CMM 2014-02 paragraph 9(a) VMS SSPs 2.8 and tasked the Secretariat to provide a report to TCC18 with suggested options and, if practical, an estimated timeline and costs to facilitate electronic (online) submission and processing of new and updated VTAFs. Any process shall track progress transparently with the relevant flag CCM that provides the VTAF."
WCPFC18,288,"The Commission also supported TCC17s’ recommendation and approved, for inclusion as Annex 2 of CMM 2014-02, a streamlined VMS reporting template for use in CCM’s Annual Part 2 Report submissions.  The Commission agreed that the template will be used in 2022, until such time as the Commission’s work developing Audit Points (including for VMS) may be completed (Attachment K).    WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  56    Issue 6 Review of Commission VMS"
WCPFC18,289,"On the issue of the review of the Commission VMS, the Commission tasked the Secretariat to provide further information in the VMS Annual Report to TCC18 on the status of implementing VMS SWG recommendations. Guidelines for the Voluntary Submission of Purse Seine processor data by CCMs to the Commission"
WCPFC18,290,WCPFC18 endorsed the draft guidelines for voluntary submissions of processor (cannery) data to the Commission (Attachment M).
WCPFC18,291,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to update Table 1 of the 2007 Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the Commission to add “Processor data” as non-public domain (HIGH risk classification) data. Draft Best Practice Guidelines for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans"
WCPFC18,292,The Commission adopted the Best Practice Guidelines for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans (Attachment N) TCC workplan
WCPFC18,293,The Commission approved the updated TCC workplan 2022 – 2024 (Attachment O). Annual Report Part 2 deadline
WCPFC18,294,The Commission noted the workload forecasted for the Secretariat to undertake in 2022 in support of the TCC workplan (WCPFC18-2021-IP12) and agreed to require CCMs in 2022 to submit their Annual Report Part 2 at least 100 days prior to TCC18 (which is a date in mid-June instead of 1 July).
WCPFC18,295,The Commission adopted the TCC17 report (WCPFC18-2021-TCC17).  9.3 NC17
WCPFC18,296,The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC18-2021-NC17: NC17 Summary Report and WCPFC18-2021-19 Reference Document for the review of CMM 2020-02 and HS 2017-02and Highlights from NC17 for Agenda 9.3. The Chair noted the discussion held on Pacific bluefin tuna under Agenda Item 7.4.
WCPFC18,297,"The NC Chair provided an update on progress on the NC17 proposal to revise the harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna, noting that IATTC adopted the change to the harvest control rule in October 2021."
WCPFC18,298,The Commission adopted the report of NC17 (WCPFC18-2021-NC17).  NC17 Proposed revised Harvest Strategy on Pacific Bluefin Tuna
WCPFC18,299,The Commission adopted the revision to the Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries (Attachment P). WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  57    9.4 Intersessional Working Groups and Intersessional Work 9.4.1  E-Reporting and E-Monitoring (ERandEM IWG)
WCPFC18,300,"The Chair informed the Commission that the Chair of the ERandEM IWG, Ms Kerry Smith of Australia, had tendered her resignation, and conveyed the Commission’s thanks and appreciation to Kerry for her enormous contribution leading the work of the ERandEM IWG for the last several years."
WCPFC18,301,"Australia thanked CCMs for their support for the issues addressed by the ERandEM IWG, and for the support given to Kerry in her role as Chair. Australia stated it would be happy to continuing chairing the WG, and would advise of a nominee in due course."
WCPFC18,302,"FSM on behalf of FFA members thanked Kerry Smith, Chair of the ERandEM IWG, for her work as Chair since the WG was formed by WCPFC11 in 2014. They acknowledged her contribution and effort through the years and wished her all the best in her new endeavour. FFA members supported Australia to continue leading the ERandEM IWG, and reiterated their proposal made during the tropical tuna measure negotiations for the Commission to establish a WCPFC regional electronic monitoring programme by 2023 and to task the ERandEM IWG to undertake the necessary work to meet this deadline.  To this end, FFA members stated the ERandEM IWG should do the necessary work and provide a proposal to TCC18 for its consideration, with a view to adopting EM standards at WCPFC19 in 2022. FFA members stated they are currently working on developing EM standards for implementation within their EEZs, and stated this could assist the work of the ERandEM IWG on this issue."
WCPFC18,303,The Commission expressed appreciation to the previous Chair (Kerry Smith) for her enormous contribution leading the work of the ERandEM IWG for the last several years.
WCPFC18,304,The Commission noted the importance of progressing ERandEM IWG work in 2022.      9.4.2  Transhipment Review (TS IWG)
WCPFC18,305,"The Co-Chairs of the TS-IWG Felix Toa Ngwango (Vanuatu) and Dr. Alex Kahl (USA), provided a brief update of the work of the working group, and referenced its report for WCPFC18 (WCPFC18-2021-TS_IWG). The Co-Chair stated that the TS-IWG was unable to reach consensus on the minimum standard data fields to be collected by transhipment observers."
WCPFC18,306,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members thanked the Co-Chairs for the update and stated they looked forward to receiving and reviewing the working group’s report in 2022 with the aim to inform the review of the transhipment measure, in order to ensure an appropriate framework is in place to regulate transhipment in the WCPO. They reiterated their proposal made under the tropical tuna measure negotiation for TCC18 to consider the work of the TS-IWG with a view to adopting a revised transhipment measure in 2022. In addition, with regards to the ROP minimum data fields for transhipment at sea, in line with FFA members’ views at TCC17, they suggested that this be sent to the TS-IWG to review the minimum data standards for monitoring of high seas transhipment to be collected by observers. They thanked the TS-IWG Co-Chairs for holding a meeting immediately prior to the start of WCPFC18, which they stated was very useful and productive.  However, the discussion at the IWG highlighted the work remaining to be done in terms of identifying the minimum fields to be collected by observers during transhipment and reiterated their view (shared at TCC17) that the IWG be given ample time to consider this issue and report to TCC18. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  58"
WCPFC18,307,PEW stated that WCPFC18-2021-OP06 A comparative analysis of AIS data with the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Reported transhipment activity in 2019 showed that prior to COVID-19 the WCPFC was the only RFMO where transhipment increased. It noted that the recommendations being considered by the Commission did not specify what data should be submitted to the Commission. The Co-Chair (USA) stated that the discussions in the IWG supported not specifying requirements regarding what data would be covered until standard data fields had been adopted.
WCPFC18,308,The Commission noted the intersessional progress report by the Review of the Transhipment CMM IWG (WCPFC18-2021-TS_IWG).
WCPFC18,309,The Commission supported the TS-IWG continuing its review of CMM 2009-06 in 2022.
WCPFC18,310,The Commission reminds members that ROP transhipment data should be submitted to the Secretariat where possible within 120 days of the observer disembarking the receiving vessel.    9.4.3  Crew labour standards
WCPFC18,311,"The Co-Chairs of the intersessional work to improve crew labour standards, Ms. Putuh Suadela (Indonesia) and Ms. Emma Hodder (New Zealand), introduced WCPFC18-2021-DP07. Update from Co-chairs on Intersessional work to improve crew labour standards. In December 2020 the Commission agreed to undertake intersessional work to improve crew labour standards, led by the Co-Chairs. Work commenced in February 2021 with multiple rounds of email feedback and a virtual workshop in July. An update was provided to TCC in September 2021. TCC17 recommended that the work continue on improving crew labour standards and an update be provided to WCPFC18. The Co-Chairs thanked members of the IWG for their excellent feedback to date, noting significant progress as included in WCPFC18-2021-DP07. While good progress was made, they noted areas that require further discussion and looked forward to working with members to further progress the work in 2022."
WCPFC18,312,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the Co-Chairs for leading the intersessional work throughout 2021. FFA Members noted that while good progress had been made, significant work remains. FFA members stated they remain committed to finalising the draft CMM and looked forward to the next meeting of the IWG, scheduled for early in 2022. FFA members recognised that this is a complex matter for many delegations, particularly because of its cross-cutting nature, and appreciated that differing views remained, both in terms of process and substance, but were encouraged that so many CCMs were willing to address the issue.  They stated their hope that all CCMs could do this and thus work through their differences, and build on the contributions so many delegations had already made.  FFA members stated they consider the matter serious and that all CCMs, and particularly large fleets, have a key role to play in taking steps to address this issue. FFA Members noted that the New Zealand Co-Chair, Ms Emma Hodder, would be leaving that role in early January, thanks her for her work, and looked forward to working with her successor in this role."
WCPFC18,313,Korea stated that the issue is very important and fully supported further work.
WCPFC18,314,"China stated it remained concerned that the draft CMM goes beyond the mandate of the Commission, and that because of this it did not participate in the intersessional work in 2021. China stated they were nonetheless very attentive to the issue, and in March 2021 China established an important regulation concerning foreign crew working on China’s fishing vessels. It expressed concerns about some elements of the current draft, and questioned how the CMM could be implemented, in view of the large number of outstanding cases in the CCFS whose resolution relies on information from observer programs. China stated it would participate in the intersessional work starting in 2022.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  59"
WCPFC18,315,"The USA thanked the Co-Chairs for leading the work, which it stated is essential; it noted the steps taken by the Commission regarding observer safety, and stated vessel crew should receive no less. The USA stated it was encouraged China would participate, and looked forward to jointly finding solutions, and hopefully having a CMM for adoption in 2022."
WCPFC18,316,"Canada stated it continued to be supportive of the work, and agreed it should be feasible to have a draft CMM ready in 2022."
WCPFC18,317,Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members welcomed the positive and constructive engagement from China and stated it appreciated the opportunity to work with them in 2022.
WCPFC18,318,"WWF expressed its sincere appreciation to the Crew Welfare intersessional work participants and the leadership of New Zealand and Indonesia in chairing that group and emphatically supported advancing this important work.  They offered particular thanks to New Zealand’s outgoing Co-Chair for her commitment and welcomed the new Co-Chair. They also thanked those members who participated diligently in the intersessional work, noting that it is an indication of the importance of the issue that very small fisheries ministries such as those in Nauru, Tokelau, and Tuvalu recognise the gravity of the issue and, despite limited resources and small teams, maintained engagement in the intersessional work at every step.  WWF noted that seemingly as with climate change, small islands have taken on the burden of fixing a problem that they have not caused or contributed to. WWF expressed its hope that larger CCMs with well-resourced ministries that did not meaningfully engage in 2021 would follow through on their commitment to do so in 2022. WWF noted some flag states are taking independent steps to address the issue at a national level and encouraged and supported those further measures, but stated that the intersessional work and the supporting analyses WWF submitted (e.g., WCPFC18-2021-OP09) solidly lay out the authority of the WCPFC and the necessary steps to address matters of crew welfare, and that the WCPFC has the authority and the obligation to address crew welfare through a binding CMM. WWF looked forward to significant progress, culminating in an agreed CMM in 2022."
WCPFC18,319,The Commission noted the report of the crew labour standards intersessional work as presented in joint Delegation Paper (WCPFC18-2021-DP07) by Indonesia and New Zealand.
WCPFC18,320,The Commission supported the continuation of the crew labour standards intersessional work led by Indonesia and New Zealand in 2022.   AGENDA ITEM 10  —  COMPLIANCE MONITORING SCHEME  10.1 Consideration and Adoption of the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR)
WCPFC18,321,"The Commission, pursuant to CMM 2019-06, considered the provisional CMR recommended by TCC17. A CMR-SWG, led by the TCC Chair, compiled the final CMR for adoption. The TCC Chair provided a report on the CMR-SWG outcomes."
WCPFC18,322,The Commission noted that there were ongoing difficulties related to interpretation of the term “actively fishing for” (and similar terms such as “directed at” and “targeting”) in CMM 2015-02 which continue to present challenges and makes it difficult for TCC to complete the assessments of some obligations during the CMR.  The Commission also noted that the disparities in available operational-level data for determined baseline periods raised difficulties in undertaking compliance assessments as WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  60    this results in some limits being based on analysis of operational-level data and other limits being based on self-reporting.
WCPFC18,323,"The Commission noted the issued raised during discussions of CMM 2015-02 and emphasized the importance of ensuring that CMMs are clear in their application, and are able to be monitored and enforced. WCPFC18 requested the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG take note of this in consideration of its future work."
WCPFC18,324,The Commission adopted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (Attachment Q).  10.2 Work to progress the CMS future work included in Section IX of CMM 2019-06 Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS-IWG)
WCPFC18,325,The Chair noted the recommendations from TCC17 for the WCPFC18 consideration and decision as set out in working paper WCPFC18-2021-28. Secretariat. Reference document for TCC17 Recommendations for Agenda 10.
WCPFC18,326,"The Chair of the CMS-IWG presented a brief update on the work of the CMS-IWG, as summarized in WCPFC18-2021-29. Draft CMS-IWG Workplan. The CMS-IWG noted that the workplan was developed in consultation with the Secretariat and the respective Leads on the development of a risk-based assessment framework (RBAF) (Ms. Heather Ward, New Zealand) and the development of audit points (Ms Rhea Moss Christian, RMI), noting that the objective of the workplan is to develop a clear timeline of the anticipated work of the CMS IWG in order to complete the tasks included in the CMS future work plan, as outlined in Section IX of CMM 2019-06. In addition, the Secretariat developed a dedicated webpage to support the organization and work of the CMS-IWG on the WCPFC website; all papers related to the work of the CMS-IWG, including those related to the elements of the workplan, will be made available on the CMS-IWG webpage."
WCPFC18,327,"Tuvalu on behalf of FFA members thanked the Chair of the CMS-IWG and the Leads for audit points and the RBAF for the draft CMS-IWG workplan. They recognized with appreciation the effort that the Chair and the Leads had put into this work in the short period of time they led the work in 2021.  They noted the draft work plan is very thorough, well prepared, and addresses all the elements under CMS future work in Section IX of CMM 2019-06. FFA members supported the draft work plan but noted that much of the work is scheduled to be done intersessionally, which can be problematic for small national administrations with many other regional and national obligations.  They noted that ideally time would be made available during TCC18 to advance this work. In addition, FFA members supported the TCC17 recommendations regarding streamlining of Annual Reporting and improving the online CCFS and reiterated their thanks to the Secretariat for its work on these aspects of the CMS."
WCPFC18,328,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, supported the FFA statement. They expressed support for the activities in the workplan, but noted that it involves a substantial amount of work, much of it intersessional. They noted other WCPFC, PNA and national priorities in 2022, including Harvest Strategy work. They also noted that this is difficult because experience has shown that is hard to participate in intersessional working groups; together with the weaknesses in the CMS CMM and factors such as the partial availability of observer data for the CMS and the reduction in data from high seas boarding and inspection activities, PNA and Tokelau considered it would be better to address the activities in the workplan at TCC, rather than undertaking a much weaker CMS process at TCC."
WCPFC18,329,China supported holding the CMS-IWG in conjunction with TCC. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  61
WCPFC18,330,The Commission noted the presentation by the TCC Vice-Chair on the work to progress CMS future work and the draft work plan for the CMS-IWG (WCPFC18-2021-28).
WCPFC18,331,"The Commission noted the intersessional progress report on the work to develop a Risk-Based Assessment Framework (RBAF) to assist CCMs to prioritise obligations for inclusion in the annual CMS, based on the risk of non-compliance of achieving CMM objectives (WCPFC18-2021-CMS-RBAF)."
WCPFC18,332,The Commission noted that the CMS-IWG workplan will be modified intersessionally to take into account the approach to the Commission’s Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2022 and 2023. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  10.3 Expiry of CMM 2019-06
WCPFC18,333,The Chair stated that the Commission needed to consider a successor measure to ensure the continued operation of the CMS beyond the expiry of CMM 2019-06 on 31 December 2021.
WCPFC18,334,"The EU supported a rollover of the CMS measure.  It noted that WCPFC18 had been working on developing the list of obligations to be reviewed in 2022, and stated that given the time constraints at WCPFC18, there was no option other than renewing the CMS CMM."
WCPFC18,335,"FSM on behalf of FFA members stated they recognized and fully appreciated the importance of a CMS in order to ensure that CCMs implement and comply with obligations arising under the Convention and CMMs, including to assess CCMs’ compliance with their WCPFC obligations, identify areas in which technical assistance or capacity building may be needed to assist CCMs in attaining compliance, identify aspects of CMMs which may require refinement or amendment for effective implementation, respond to non-compliance by CCMs through remedial and/or preventative options, and monitor and resolve outstanding instances of non-compliance by CCMs with their WCPFC obligations. They noted that the first scheme was adopted by WCPFC7 in 2010 through CMM 2010-06 and had undergone many iterations.  FFA members stated that 2021 was the eleventh year that the CMS has been in place, and stated they have consistently voiced their concern that the scheme is flawed in ways that results in disproportionate burden on SIDS. FFA members stated that prior to the CMS coming into force in 2011, they had actively managed the fishery in their waters by putting robust measures in place and would continue to do so, irrespective of the CMS.  They stated that one of the flaws — not necessarily as a result of the CMS, but of the management framework of the Commission — is that while FFA members have been rigorously managing the fisheries in-zone, the management framework in the high seas requires much improvement.  They also noted the imbalance between the measure in place for purse seine vs longline fisheries. FFA members stated that Section IX of the CMS measure commits the Commission to a multi-year workplan of tasks to enhance the scheme, with the aim of making it more efficient and effective by streamlining the processes.  FFA members stated they had been in the forefront of trying to progress some of this work, including in 2021. They stated that in their view in 2021 the Commission and TCC need to put aside dedicated time to progress these tasks in order to enhance the CMS and address its current flaws"
WCPFC18,336,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA, stated that the CMS is flawed in ways that reduces its value to them. They noted that they have committed substantial effort to reforming the CMS, especially in moving away from vessel-level compliance and through improvements to the CCFS. They suggested it is clearly very difficult to complete the work in a COVID setting while carrying on the CMS business as usual, and that 2022 would provide an opportunity to complete the work needed on the CMS by putting aside the CMR review for 2022 and working instead on the reforms. They noted that the CMS depends heavily on observer data, and with the suspension of observer obligations the observer data available will be even more biased because there will be more reports for fleets that have voluntarily made the special effort of continuing to  62    carry observers. There will also be less information from high seas boarding and inspection reports. They noted that a shortened virtual TCC session, as in 2021, leaves little time for anything other than core business if there is a full CMS review, while the CMS-IWG workplan clearly shows how much work there is to be done, including work on Audit Points, the RBAF, use of the aggregated summary tables, trial of CCFS improvements, and revising CMM 2019-06. In the workplan, much intersessional work is planned, but SIDS are disadvantaged in participation in intersessional processes. Focusing on finishing the work on the CMS at TCC18 would enable the important tasks in the workplan to be completed effectively, in a way that would also allow more effective SIDS participation. PNA and Tokelau stated that for that reason, they did not support rolling over or extending the CMM in its current form."
WCPFC18,337,"The USA stated their view that it is essential that the Commission have a robust CMS in place in 2022. The USA noted it had been very involved in this for over a decade and had worked to make the necessary adjustments to ensure it works well for the Commission. It stated that the CMS is a fundamental requirement of the Commission, and that it was unacceptable that it be put aside for a year; it would mean that the WCPFC would be the sole RFMO without a CMS. The USA acknowledged that much work needs to be done, and stated that being able to work intersessionally was essential. It expressed a willingness to extend TCC to conduct both the CMR and do the other work, and stated it was prepared to engage in any of the working groups, and take on leadership roles where others think the USA could be helpful. It emphasized it could not agree to not having a CMS in 2022, as this would harm the integrity of the Commission, and was not an acceptable way forward. It stressed the need to have a CMS and still make good progress on the other needed work."
WCPFC18,338,"Canada stated its understanding of the Commission’s challenging position, and supported the remarks by the USA."
WCPFC18,339,"The EU supported the views expressed by the USA, stating it would not be acceptable to have a one-year gap with no CMR review. The EU suggested it was disrespectful to suggest CCMs should work on the list of obligations but then be informed some CCMs were not willing to conduct the review in 2022 in any event, and stated it would have been more honest to have this made clear from the outset of WCPFC18. It emphasized that it was essential that the CMR be reviewed in 2022."
WCPFC18,340,"PNG stressed that as the chair of the PNA when statements were made on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau it was after a lengthy process and considered discussions and reflections. They stated that they sought to engage in an open and honest process, and were always very clear when CMMs were not working for them, and sought balance in terms of their responses, actions and engagement. They stated they did not accept that it is incumbent on the Commission to prepare a CMR, and stated that prior to the trial of the CMS, CCMs engaged in Part 2 reporting. They acknowledged mutual accountability for the CMMs that are agreed to, but stated it is not necessarily a core function of the Commission to have a CMR or a CMS. They looked forward to progressing to a system that works for all CCMs."
WCPFC18,341,"Tuvalu supported the statement made by Tokelau, noting that the Commission is reforming the CMS, but the work was not complete as a result of COVID-19 and tropical tuna measure negotiations. It suggested 2022 would provide opportunity to complete the work needed on the CMS by putting aside the CMR; noting the case for doing that was strengthened by the reduced observer and boarding and inspection report data for 2021, the volume of tasks in the CMS Workplan, and the Secretariat’s workload. They supported not having a CMR review in 2022 and instead focusing on undertaking some of the work in the CMS-IWG workplan."
WCPFC18,342,"Korea supported the interventions from the USA and the EU, and advocated extending the current CMS for at least one year.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  63"
WCPFC18,343,"Australia suggested that both compliance obligations and the CMS revisions were of critical importance, and noted strong support for the intersessional work outlined. It supported the statements made by FFA, and suggested looking at how the Commission could advance the needed work to revise the CMS while respecting the Commission’s compliance obligations. It suggested an alternative needed to be found to a simple rollover of the CMS CMM, and suggested the need to specifically state what would be undertaken in 2022."
WCPFC18,344,"Tokelau noted that its participation in efforts to test the list of obligations and RBAF were separate from a decision on the CMS CMM, and CMR requirements for 2022. It noted that the Convention addresses compliance review, but that this is not necessarily an annual review. Tokelau stated it wanted to ensure that the CMS and CMR are fair and effective."
WCPFC18,345,"New Zealand stated that the CMS is an essential mechanism to hold CCMs to account and deter noncompliance, and voiced its commitment to improving the effectiveness of the CMS, including through the RBAF. It supported the comments from Australia, and stated that if there was no CMR process in 2022, other key processes should continue. It stated its preference would be for TCC18 to have the scope to both substantively address the CMS work program and a CMR, but if that did not take place, elements of the CMR (such as CCM reporting) should continue in 2022 to ensure ongoing accountability for CCMs."
WCPFC18,346,"ISSF stated its deep concern that the extension of the CMS measure was in jeopardy, as this would mean the WCPFC would have no CMS, which would make the WCPFC the only RFMO without a CMS. ISSF stated that this would place the Commission in breach of the Convention, UNFSA, and other obligations.  It stated that in the absence of a mechanism to assess the level of compliance CMMs would lose their value, sending a strong signal that would reduce public and market confidence. It strongly urged CCMs to reconsider their positions and extend the CMS at WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,347,"The Ocean Foundation supported the intervention by ISSF, noting that the CMS CMM is one of the Commission’s most important measures. It stated that the WCPFC is the largest RFMO in terms of catches under management, and that this would raise fundamental issues with regard to whether CMMs are achieving their intended objectives. It stressed that the important work of compliance assessment must continue. It agreed with the need to move as quickly as possible to address the issues identified with regard to the CMS, but stated that an imperfect measure is better than no measure at all."
WCPFC18,348,"Pew supported the comments by ISSF and Ocean Foundation. It stated that IATTC in 2020 shocked the tuna world by almost having no tuna measure, and that for WCPFC to have no CMS would be akin to that. Pew stated that it was well aware that the current CMS was far from perfect, but having no CMS would be worse. It stated that not renewing the CMS would be viewed with great concern."
WCPFC18,349,"RMI stated that in its current form the CMS is unfair and prejudiced SIDS, and that they derive no value from the process. It advocated fixing the problems prior to approval of another CMS CMM."
WCPFC18,350,"The Chair encouraged CCMs to consider the suggestions by Australia and New Zealand, and encouraged CCMs to find a middle ground that accommodated all concerns expressed."
WCPFC18,351,"In the course of further discussions, CCMs agreed that they had joint obligations with respect to the Convention and the Commission’s CMMs, and that review of compliance with these obligations is an essential function of the Commission. CCMs also agreed on the need to devote additional time in 2022 at TCC18 to progressing revisions of the CMS and CMR. CCMs agreed to extend the CMS CMM by two years (until 31 December 2023), and to defer the CMR process in 2022 to allow consideration of revisions to the CMS and the CMR process.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  64"
WCPFC18,352,"The Commission agreed that the Commission’s Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMM 2019-06) would continue in force for until 31 December 2023 (CMM 2021-03, Attachment R), with the following amendments: i. The Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) assessment review process (provisional CMR and final CMR process), including the review of the aggregate tables, shall be deferred in 2022 so that the Technical and Compliance Committee can dedicate appropriate time to the completion of CMS Future Work components (Section IX); ii. TCC18 shall focus on completing the development of audit points, a risk-based assessment framework and the development of guidelines for observer participation in the CMS and provide recommendations to WCPFC19 to support WCPFC19’s adoption of these work areas. TCC18 shall also continue to consider: a. the process for reviewing the aggregated information referred to in paragraph 26(ii); b. the other components of the CMS Future Work;  c. further improvements to the compliance case file system; and d. appropriate compliance assessment decision making processes. iii. WCPFC19 shall adopt audit points and a risk-based assessment framework for use in the 2023 CMR review; iv. Notwithstanding subparagraph i) in 2022 and 2023, CCMs shall submit Annual Reports Part 1 and 2, Scientific data to be submitted to the Commission and Fished and Did not Fish report (CMM 2018-06 09); and v. In 2023, TCC19 shall consider a CMR that assesses CCMs’ compliance over the previous 2 year reporting period (RY2021 and RY2022) using the agreed audit point and risk-based assessment framework adopted by WCPFC19.   10.4 List of obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2022"
WCPFC18,353,"The Chair of the List of Obligations SWG, Ms Heather Ward (NZ) summarised the outcomes of the SWG, noting that the SWG had agreed on a total of 60 obligations to be assessed in 2022."
WCPFC18,354,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA, supported the list recommended by the SWG."
WCPFC18,355,"The Commission agreed to the List of Obligations to guide the preparation by the Secretariat of the draft CMR in 2022, covering 2021 activities (Attachment S).   AGENDA ITEM 11  — ADOPTION OF THE 2022 IUU VESSEL LIST"
WCPFC18,356,"The Chair introduced WCPFC18-2021-30: WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2022, which presented for the consideration of WCPFC18 the relevant information for a decision on the 2022 WCPFC IUU Vessel List, in accordance with CMM 2019-07.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  65"
WCPFC18,357,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members supported the retention of the three fishing vessels NEPTUNE, FU LIEN No.1 and YU FONG 168 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2022. They stated that at TCC17, FFA members requested Chinese Taipei to respond to specific questions relating to the three vessels. The questions were conveyed to Chinese Taipei during TCC17 and are reflected in the TCC17 Summary Report. FFA members stated that they looked forward to receiving a response. In addition, they sought specific information from Panama in relation to their registration of the vessel FU LIEN NO.1 (IMO: 7355662), noting that during TCC17 Panama indicated that the vessel was no longer registered under the Panama Registry. FFA Members asked Panama to specify the period when the vessel was registered under the Panama Registry."
WCPFC18,358,"Panama stated it consulted with the Maritime Authority of Panama, the Institution in charge of flag registrations, and on September 24, 2021 they certified that there is no evidence of registration of the vessel in question under the Panamanian flag. Panama stated that if the Secretariat required, Panama could provide the documentation in English."
WCPFC18,359,The Commission agreed to maintain the three vessels currently on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and adopted the 2021 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment T).    IUU Cross Listing
WCPFC18,360,The Chair noted that the EU’s proposal WCPFC18-2021-DP03 rev3 Proposal for amending CMM 2019-07 (WCPFC IUU Vessel List) was introduced under Agenda Item
WCPFC18,361,"The EU stated that in addition to Canada, Japan, and Chinese Taipei, Korea had joined as a co-sponsor. It thanked the co-sponsors and other CCMs for their comments, which it stated had helped improve the proposed text"
WCPFC18,362,"Canada, Chinese Taipei, Japan and Korea stated their support for the proposal, noting that in their view it would benefit all CCMs. They asked CCMs to consider the intent of the proposal, and noted that the practice has been adopted by all other RFMOs."
WCPFC18,363,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the proponents. They stated that since 2019, FFA members have raised concerns regarding cross listing, and have noted that the proposal for cross-listing would have significantly more impact on national administrations than suggested by the EU, without any material benefit in their effort to combat IUU fishing in the WCPO.  At WCPFC16 FFA members requested the EU to provide a proper analysis of the administrative, institutional and legal implications of cross-listing.  FFA members stated they were again requesting that the EU respond to questions raised regarding the implications of the proposal. FFA members stated they had repeatedly called for complete and accurate CMM 2013-06 assessments, and that if the CMM 2013-06 assessment is not complete and accurate, then it is not acceptable. They stated that the CMM 2013-06 assessment provided in WCPFC18-2021-DP03 states there will be no additional resources required, including financial and human capacity, to implement the proposal.  FFA members stated their view that this is inaccurate given the additional administrative burden on members and the Secretariat. FFA members stated they are not in a position to support the proposed amendments to CMM 2019-07 and invited the EU to consider whether there are other cooperative approaches that can be taken to support efforts to combat IUU fishing."
WCPFC18,364,"China stated that it is member of other tuna RFMOS, which have adopted similar measures, and thus it generally supported the concept. However, China stated that after about 4 years during which cross listing has been implemented by other RFMOs, two problems had emerged. One is legal: there are a number WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  66    of RFMOs of which China is not a member, and in those cases it is difficult for China to take action, noting that this was the case for CCSBT. China also noted difficulties associated with de-listings, and whether the process would be undertaken automatically under the EU’ proposal. It noted that these practical issues made it difficult for China to support the proposal, and suggested the EU consider removing CCSTB from the list of RFMOs whose IUU vessel lists would be cross listed."
WCPFC18,365,"Palau stated it lacked staff capacity to undertake the required work, and stated it and other members of PNA and Tokelau could not support the proposal. It noted the proposal’s CMM 2013-06 assessment ignored the obligations of paragraph 22."
WCPFC18,366,"The EU stated it would be open to seeking accommodation of specific issues such as that raised by China. Regarding comments by the PNA and Tokelau, it stated that it had sought to demonstrate in its submission the proposal would reduce rather than increase the burden placed on small administrations."
WCPFC18,367,"Cook Islands supported the comments from Palau, stating these were consistent with the comments from FFA members, and had been expressed for several years. It urged the EU to understand that small administrations are in a very different position from large ones, and that the proposal would require a substantial change in the way small administrations operate. It stated that SIDS have the need and right to target their resources in ways that have the most impact, and that they do this with the support and assistance of the FCC secretariat. Cook Islands stated that their approach is working, and that they would be willing to discuss other ways to cooperate on the IUU vessel issue."
WCPFC18,368,"The EU thanked the co-sponsors of is proposal for their support and constructive contributions, while noting that the following statement was made strictly on behalf the EU delegation. It stated disappointment that despite the efforts, outreach and assessments undertaken during the last two years the proposal was not adopted due to the opposition of FFA. The EU stated it was very concerned that CMM 2013-06 was advocated as an argument for opposing the proposal. It noted the lack of common understanding or clear process about the requirements of CMM 2013-06, and stated that it proactively reached out to the FFA and individual FFA members intersessionally on several occasions, especially during 2021, seeking feedback and guidance for the assessment, but that very little if any feedback was received, including at WCPFC18. The EU stated that in the absence of willingness from FFA members to engage with the EU delegation, advocating CMM 2013-06 in this context was unjustified, and that by doing so FFA members were taking the risk of undermining the scope and initial intent of that CMM. It stated that various funding opportunities for capacity building were available that could possibly assist SIDS to overcome any difficulties related to the implementation of a cross listing procedure that could be identified, and noted that the CMS itself provides opportunities through the Capacity Assistance status to provide support to SIDS that might face implementation challenges with specific WCPFC obligations. At WCPFC18 FFA members supported another proposal on the basis that the amendments proposed were already adopted by FFA and included in its Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions for Access by Fishing Vessels. The EU stated that it found it striking that FFA has already adopted the cross-listing principle in Annex 4 of its Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions for Access by Fishing Vessels (MTCs) that state “The Director-General is required to review IUU Vessel Lists as a background check on each vessel that is the subject of an application for registration. An application for registrations from any fishing vessel which is listed in any of the following IUU lists shall be rejected”. The EU Stated that despite this FFA members remained unwilling to support the proposal for introducing cross-listing in WCPFC, and that the main question was why FFA members opposed a measure they have adopted internally, which undermines the constructive efforts of WCPFC members to improve the capacity of WCPFC to fight against IUU in the WCPO and at global level. The EU stated that it believes this outstanding question deserves at least an honest answer."
WCPFC18,369,"The Cook Islands responded to the EU’s statement highlighting that the FFA had made several constructive attempts over many years to explain their concerns to the EU. The Cook Islands expressed that WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  67    it was unfortunate, unfair and offensive for the EU to suggest that the FFA had not been constructive, or that the FFA was not committed to combatting IUU fishing simply because of a disagreement on the administrative and institutional utility of their proposal. The Cook Islands highlighted the success of the FFA’s cooperative efforts to combat IUU fishing.  The Cook Islands further identified that capacity building needs should be identified by SIDS, not by other CCMs who direct capacity building to support their own objectives rather than SIDS’ objectives."
WCPFC18,370,Palau fully supported the statement by Cook Islands.   AGENDA ITEM 12  — REPORT OF FAC15 12.1 Report of the Fifteenth Finance and Administration Committee
WCPFC18,371,The FAC Co-Chair Mr. Michael Brakke (USA) reported the key highlights and recommendations of FAC15 and referenced the Summary Report (WCPFC18-2021-FAC15).
WCPFC18,372,"RMI on behalf of PNA and Tokelau raised concern about the process used by FAC to prioritise SC projects for funding, as addressed in paragraph 30 of the FAC15 Summary Report, and stated that their preference in the future would be for FAC to adhere to the project priorities as determined by SC."
WCPFC18,373,The EU supported comment from the PNA and Tokelau. 12.2 Budget Approval for 2022 and Indicative Budgets for 2023 and 2024
WCPFC18,374,"The Commission considered the budget recommended by the FAC. After further deliberation, the Commission decided to fund the six intersessional working groups that will be held virtually in the amount of $68,000 and the Science Manager Dialog that will be held for two days after SC in the amount of $94,500. With these changes, the Commission adopted a budget of $8,471,636 for 2022."
WCPFC18,375,"The Commission endorsed the FAC15 recommendation in paragraph 9 of the FAC15 Summary Report, and accepted the audited financial statements for 2020 (WCPFC18-2021-FAC15-05)."
WCPFC18,376,"The Commission noted the deferment of further discussion on Professional Staff Salary to FAC16, when an updated tri-annual salary market review will be available, and encouraged the informal small working group led by Cook Islands to continue its deliberations intersessionally with a view towards helping to inform an appropriate consensus outcome on this issue at FAC16."
WCPFC18,377,"The Commission adopted the report of the Fifteenth Session of the FAC (WCPFC18-2021FAC15), noting the proposed 2022 budget of $ 8,309,136 and indicative budgets for 2023 and 2024 of $ 8,505,480 and $ 8,374,893 respectively (Attachment U)."
WCPFC18,378,"The Commission further considered the budget recommended by the FAC. After further deliberation, the Commission decided to fund the six intersessional working groups that will be held virtually in the amount of $68,000 and the Science Manager Dialogue that will be held for two days after SC in the amount of $94,500. With these changes, the Commission adopted a budget of $8,471,636 for 2022."

WCPFC18,380,"The Commission made a number of appointments to Commission positions commencing after the end of WCPFC18 (8 December 2021): i. Dr Tuikolongahau Halafihi, CEO of the Ministry of Fisheries of the Kingdom of Tonga was appointed SC Chair; and  ii. Mr Michael Brakke (United States) was reappointed, and David Power (Australia) was appointed to serve as FAC Co-Chairs."
WCPFC18,381,"In support of 2022 Intersessional activities, to be progressed electronically, the Commission confirmed the following: i. Ms Neomai Ravitu (Fiji) would continue to lead the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG;  ii. Australia would continue to lead the ERandEMWG, name to be advised; iii.

Ms Heather Ward (New Zealand) would continue to lead the risk-based assessment framework task and Ms Rhea Moss-Christian (RMI) would continue to lead the development of audit points in support of the CMS IWG Chair."
WCPFC18,382,"The Chair noted that the positions of Vice-Chair for the SC, ROP-IWG Chair and CDS-IWG Chair remain vacant and that nominations for these positions would be invited intersessionally in 2022.  13.2 Future Meetings"
WCPFC18,383,"The EU commented that when scheduling future online meetings, should these be required, that a lesson to draw from the WCPFC meetings held during 2021 is that the sessions as scheduled provided insufficient time to conduct the needed work. This required that many meeting days be extended with very short notice, which the EU stated proved difficult for its delegation, and possibly for others. The EU suggested that the Commission agree to include additional sessions in future virtual meetings to address this concern. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  69"
WCPFC18,384,The Commission acknowledged that with the COVID-19 pandemic likely to continue into 2022 it was difficult to predict the feasibility of convening physical meetings next year.
WCPFC18,385,"In the event that physical meetings for 2022 are feasible the Commission agreed on the following meeting venues and dates:   i. SC18 would be held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia from Wednesday 10 to Thursday 18 August 2022; ii. The First Science-Management Dialogue would be held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia Friday 19 and Monday 22 August 2022; iii. NC18 would be held in Japan (venue and date to be advised); iv. TCC18 would be held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia from Wednesday 21 to Tuesday 27 September 2022; v. WCPFC19 would be held in Vietnam in December 2022, with dates to be confirmed by Vietnam in consultation with Secretariat.  3. In the event that physical meetings for 2022 are not feasible, the expedited decision-making procedure used in 2020 and 2021 will also be used to facilitate each decision by the Commission to convene virtual meetings in 2022     13.3 Timeline for recruitment of a new Executive Director"
WCPFC18,386,The Finance and Administration Manager explained the process and timeline for recruitment of a new Executive Director.  4. The Commission agreed to the timeline for the recruitment of a new Executive Director for WCPFC set out in WCPFC18-2021-31 (Attachment W).   AGENDA ITEM 14  — OTHER MATTERS
WCPFC18,387,The Chair noted that the delegation from Ecuador submitted the following statement for the consideration of WCPFC18.
WCPFC18,388,"Ecuador conveyed the greetings of the Government of Ecuador, wished success in the deliberations of WCPFC, and expressed appreciation to the members of the WCPFC for renewing Ecuador’s CNM status, which has been granted since 2009. Ecuador recalled its commitment to fully comply with the Commission’s CMMs and all administrative and financial obligations, and stated that it has done this. It also expressed its support to:  (i) enforce tropical tuna conservation and management measures for all fleets that limits fishing mortality for bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack;  (ii) adopt a work plan for FADs with a timeframe to transition from traditional FADs to primarily FADs made primarily from biodegradable materials; and develop FAD recovery policies, marking procedures, and ownership rules; (iii) adopt target reference points for bigeye and yellowfin;  (iv) adopt a CMM for an Electronic Observers’ Monitoring Program and Minimum Standards for the use of electronic monitoring in all WCPFC fisheries; and  (v) continue the work towards reforming at-sea transhipment CMM and CMS.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  70"
WCPFC18,389,"Ecuador stated it has expressed its desire to become full member of WCPFC at several WCPFC annual meetings, but that unfortunately, Ecuador's request has not been well received. Given this, Ecuador officially asked what the legal procedure would be to achieve that objective, aspiring that it should be clear, fair, and transparent. It recalled that at WCPFC14 the USA delivered a discussion document on this issue, and that it had also been raised by the EU. It noted that their analysis would facilitate the delayed treatment that has been given to this important matter. It noted that in 2015 WCPFC took a first step by implementing a change in the “CNM application form”, in which candidate countries were asked whether they would like to become full members. In this regard, Ecuador inquired again what the benefit of this question is, and if there had been any follow-up. It reminded CCMs that the general framework of RFMOs states that no State or group of States that have a real interest in the fisheries should be discriminated against, and that Ecuador and most members of the WCPFC are parties to UNCLOS and the UNFSA, which are pillars of the international legal framework for fishing and the oceans. In this regard, Ecuador considers that officially and repeatedly informing WCPFC of its interest in becoming a “full member” while receiving no response constitutes discrimination and a violation of the UNCLOS and UNFSA rules. It noted the foregoing contrasts with the treatment given to states in other RFMOs. By way of example, following adoption of the new IATTC Convention in Antigua, Guatemala in 2003, the IATTC accepted several coastal states not located in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (e.g., Belize, the People's Republic of China, and Kiribati) to become full members with no barrier. Ecuador reiterated its request that the Commission consider establishing a framework and conditions to allow interested CNMs to become full Members.
