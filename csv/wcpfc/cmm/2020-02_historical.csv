2020-02_historical,historical,1,"This conservation and management measure has been prepared to implement the Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries (Harvest Strategy 2017-02), and the Northern Committee shall periodically review and recommend revisions to this measure as needed to implement the Harvest Strategy.  Management measures"
2020-02_historical,historical,2,CCMs shall take measures necessary to ensure that:  (1) Total fishing effort by their vessel fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna in the area north of the 20° N shall stay below the 2002–2004 annual average levels.  (2) All catches of Pacific bluefin tuna less than 30 kg shall be reduced to 50% of the 2002– 2004 annual average levels. Any overage or underage of the catch limit shall be deducted from or may be added to the catch limit for the following year. The maximum underage that a CCM may carry over in any given year shall not exceed 5% of its annual initial catch limit.1
2020-02_historical,historical,3,"CCMs shall take measures necessary to ensure that all catches of Pacific Bluefin tuna 30kg or larger shall not be increased from the 2002-2004 annual average levels.2 Any overage or underage of the catch limit shall be deducted from or may be added to the catch limit for the following year. The maximum underage that a CCM may carry over in any given year shall not exceed 5% of its annual initial catch limit1. However, in 2021 CCMs may use part of the catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna  1 Notwithstanding paragraph 2 and 3, a CCM may carry over up to 17% of its initial 2020 catch limits, which remain uncaught, to 2021. 2 CCMs with a base line catch of 10 t or less may increase its catch as long as it does not exceed 10 t. 3  smaller than 30 kg stipulated in paragraph 2 (2) above to catch Pacific bluefin tuna 30 kg or larger in the same year. In this case, the amount of catch 30 kg or larger shall be counted against the catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna smaller than 30 kg. CCMs shall not use the catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna 30 kg or larger to catch Pacific bluefin tuna smaller than 30 kg. The ISC is requested to review, in its work referred to in Section 5 of Harvest Strategy, the implications of this special provision in terms of PBF mortality and stock rebuilding probabilities in 2021. Based on that review, in 2021 the Northern Committee will determine whether it should be continued past 2021, and if so, recommend changes to the CMM as appropriate."
2020-02_historical,historical,4,"All CCMs except Japan shall implement the limits in paragraph 2 and 3 on a calendar-year basis. Japan shall implement the limits using a management year other than the calendar year for some of its fisheries and have its implementation assessed with respect to its management year. To facilitate the assessment, Japan shall: a. Use the following management years: 1. For its fisheries licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, use the calendar year as the management year. 2. For its other fisheries, use 1 April – 31 March as the management year.3  b. In its annual reports for PBF, for each category described in a.1 and a.2 above, complete the required reporting template for both the management year and calendar year clearly identifying fisheries for each management year."
2020-02_historical,historical,5,"CCMs shall report to the Executive Director by 31 July each year their fishing effort and <30 kg and >=30 kg catch levels, by fishery, for the previous 3 year, accounting for all catches, including discards. The Executive Director will compile this information each year into an appropriate format for the use of the Northern Committee."
2020-02_historical,historical,7,"CCMs, in particular those catching juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna, shall take measures to monitor and obtain prompt results of recruitment of juveniles each year."
2020-02_historical,historical,8,"Consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, and in accordance with domestic laws and regulations, CCMs shall, to the extent possible, take measures necessary to prevent commercial transaction of Pacific bluefin tuna and its products that undermine the effectiveness of this CMM, especially measures prescribed in the paragraph 2 and 3 above. CCMs shall cooperate for this purpose."
2020-02_historical,historical,9,CCMs shall cooperate to establish a catch documentation scheme (CDS) to be applied to Pacific bluefin tuna in accordance with the Attachment of this CMM.
2020-02_historical,historical,10,"CCMs shall also take measures necessary to strengthen monitoring and data collecting system for Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries and farming in order to improve the data quality and timeliness of all the data reporting.   3 For the category described a.2, the TCC shall assess in year 20XX its implementation during the management year that starts 1 April 20XX-1 (e.g., in the 2020 compliance review, the TCC will assess Japan’s implementation for its fisheries licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries during calendar-year 2019 and for its other fisheries during 1 April 2019 through 31 March 2020). 4"
2020-02_historical,historical,11,"CCMs shall report to Executive Director by 31 July annually measures they used to implement paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 13 of this CMM. CCMs shall also monitor the international trade of the products derived from Pacific bluefin tuna and report the results to Executive Director by 31 July annually. The Northern Committee shall annually review those reports CCMs submit pursuant to this paragraph and if necessary, advise a CCM to take an action for enhancing its compliance with this CMM."
2020-02_historical,historical,12,The WCPFC Executive Director shall communicate this CMM to the IATTC Secretariat and its contracting parties whose fishing vessels engage in fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna in EPO and request them to take equivalent measures in conformity with this CMM.
2020-02_historical,historical,13,"To enhance effectiveness of this measure, CCMs are encouraged to communicate with and, if appropriate, work with the concerned IATTC contracting parties bilaterally."
2020-02_historical,historical,14,"The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not prejudice the legitimate rights and obligations under international law of those small island developing State Members and participating territories in the Convention Area whose current fishing activity for Pacific bluefin tuna is limited, but that have a real interest in fishing for the species, that may wish to develop their own fisheries for Pacific bluefin tuna in the future."
2020-02_historical,historical,15,"The provisions of paragraph 14 shall not provide a basis for an increase in fishing effort by fishing vessels owned or operated by interests outside such developing coastal State, particularly Small Island Developing State Members or participating territories, unless such fishing is conducted in support of efforts by such Members and territories to develop their own domestic fisheries."
2020-02_historical,historical,16,"This CMM replaces CMM 2019-02. On the basis of stock assessment conducted by ISC in 2020, and other pertinent information, this CMM shall be reviewed and may be amended as appropriate in 2021. "
