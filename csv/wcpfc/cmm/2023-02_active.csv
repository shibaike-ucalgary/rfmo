2023-02_active,active,1,"This conservation and management measure has been prepared to implement the Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries (Harvest Strategy 2017-02), and the Northern Committee shall  2  periodically review and recommend revisions to this measure as needed to implement the Harvest Strategy.    Management measures"
2023-02_active,active,2,CCMs shall take measures necessary to ensure that total fishing effort by their vessel fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna in the area north of the 20° N shall stay below the 2002–2004 annual average levels.
2023-02_active,active,3,"Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei shall, respectively, take measures necessary to ensure that its catches of Pacific bluefin tuna less than 30 kg and Pacific bluefin tuna 30 kg or larger shall not exceed the annual catch limits in the tables below. The basis for the limits is as follows; annual catch limits for Pacific bluefin tuna less than 30 kg are 50% of the 2002-2004 average annual levels and annual catch limits for Pacific bluefin tuna 30 kg or larger are 115% of the 2002-2004 average annual levels or 30 metric tons for a CCM who does not have an initial catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna 30 kg or larger before 2022.     Pacific Bluefin tuna less than 30kg    2002-2004 average annual level  Annual initial catch limit  Japan      8,015 metric tons        4,007 metric tons  Korea      1,435 metric tons         718 metric tons    Pacific Bluefin tuna 30kg or larger    2002-2004 average annual level  Annual initial catch limit  Japan      4,882 metric tons        5,614 metric tons  Korea         0 metric tons          30 metric tons  Chinese Taipei      1,709 metric tons        1,965 metric tons"
2023-02_active,active,4,"CCMs, not described in paragraph 3, may increase their catch of Pacific bluefin tuna 30kg or larger by 15% above their 2002-2004 annual average levels. CCMs with a base line catch of 10 tons or less of Pacific bluefin tuna 30 kg or larger may increase their catch as long as it does not exceed 10 metric tons per year."
2023-02_active,active,5,Any overage or underage of the catch limit shall be deducted from or may be added to the catch limit for the following year. The maximum underage that a CCM may carry over in any given year shall not exceed 5% of its annual initial catch limit.1 1
2023-02_active,active,6,"CCMs described in paragraph 3 may use part of the catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna smaller than 30kg stipulated in paragraph 3 above to catch Pacific bluefin tuna 30kg or larger in the same year. In this case, the amount of catch 30kg or larger shall be counted against the catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna smaller than 30kg2. CCMs shall not use the catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna 30kg or larger to catch Pacific bluefin tuna smaller than 30kg.   1 Notwithstanding paragraph 5, a CCM may carry over up to 17% of its initial catch limits in 2021, 2022 and 2023, which remain uncaught, to 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  2 In 2022, 2023 and 2024, a CCM may count the amount of catch 30kg or larger adjusted with the conversion factor 0.68 (catch 30kg or larger multiplied by 0.68) against the catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna smaller than 30kg up to  3"
2023-02_active,active,7,"All CCMs except Japan shall implement the limits in paragraph 3 on a calendar-year basis. Japan shall implement the limits using a management year other than the calendar year for some of its fisheries and have its implementation assessed with respect to its management year. To facilitate the assessment, Japan shall:   a. Use the following management years:   1. For its fisheries licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, use the calendar year as the management year.   2. For its other fisheries, use 1 April – 31 March as the management year3.   b. In its annual reports for PBF, for each category described in a.1 and a.2 above, complete the required reporting template for both the management year and calendar year clearly identifying fisheries for each management year."
2023-02_active,active,8,"CCMs shall report to the Executive Director by 31 July each year their fishing effort and <30 kg and >=30 kg catch levels, by fishery, for the previous 3 year, accounting for all catches, including discards. CCMs shall report their annual catch limits and their annual catches of PBF, with adequate computation details, to present their implementation for paragraph 5 and 6, if the measures and arrangements in the said paragraphs and relevant footnotes applied. The Executive Director will compile this information each year into an appropriate format for the use of the Northern Committee."
2023-02_active,active,9,"CCMs shall intensify cooperation for effective implementation of this CMM, including juvenile catch reduction."
2023-02_active,active,10,"CCMs, in particular those catching juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna, shall take measures to monitor and obtain prompt results of recruitment of juveniles each year."
2023-02_active,active,11,"Consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, and in accordance with domestic laws and regulations, CCMs shall, to the extent possible, take measures necessary to prevent commercial transaction of Pacific bluefin tuna and its products that undermine the effectiveness of this CMM, especially measures prescribed in the paragraph 3 above. CCMs shall cooperate for this purpose."
2023-02_active,active,12,CCMs shall cooperate to establish a catch documentation scheme (CDS) to be applied to Pacific bluefin tuna in accordance with the Attachment of this CMM.
2023-02_active,active,13,"CCMs shall also take measures necessary to strengthen monitoring and data collecting system for Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries and farming in order to improve the data quality and timeliness of all the data reporting.    30% of its initial catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna smaller than 30kg. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this footnote, a CCM who does not have an initial catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna 30kg or larger before 2022 may apply the conversion factor 0.68 up to 40% instead of 30% of its initial catch limit for Pacific bluefin tuna less than 30kg for the same period. 3 For the category described a.2 of paragraph 7, the TCC shall assess in year 20XX its implementation during the management year that starts 1 April 20XX-1 (e.g., in the 2020 compliance review, the TCC will assess Japan’s implementation for its fisheries licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries during calendar-year 2019 and for its other fisheries during 1 April 2019 through 31 March 2020)  4"
2023-02_active,active,14,"CCMs shall report to Executive Director by 31 July annually measures they used to implement paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11 13 and 16 of this CMM. CCMs shall also monitor the international trade of the products derived from Pacific bluefin tuna and report the results to Executive Director by 31 July annually. The Northern Committee shall annually review those reports CCMs submit pursuant to this paragraph and if necessary, advise a CCM to take an action for enhancing its compliance with this CMM."
2023-02_active,active,15,The WCPFC Executive Director shall communicate this CMM to the IATTC Secretariat and its contracting parties whose fishing vessels engage in fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna in EPO and request them to take equivalent measures in conformity with this CMM.
2023-02_active,active,16,"To enhance effectiveness of this measure, CCMs are encouraged to communicate with and, if appropriate, work with the concerned IATTC contracting parties bilaterally."
2023-02_active,active,17,"The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not prejudice the legitimate rights and obligations under international law of those small island developing State Members and participating territories in the Convention Area whose current fishing activity for Pacific bluefin tuna is limited, but that have a real interest in fishing for the species, that may wish to develop their own fisheries for Pacific bluefin tuna in the future."
2023-02_active,active,18,"The provisions of paragraph 17 shall not provide a basis for an increase in fishing effort by fishing vessels owned or operated by interests outside such developing coastal State, particularly Small Island Developing State Members or participating territories, unless such fishing is conducted in support of efforts by such Members and territories to develop their own domestic fisheries."
2023-02_active,active,19,"This CMM replaces CMM 2021-02. On the basis of stock assessment conducted by ISC in 2024, and other pertinent information, this CMM shall be reviewed and may be amended as appropriate in 2024.            "
