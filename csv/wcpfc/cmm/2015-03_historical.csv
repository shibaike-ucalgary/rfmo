2015-03_historical,historical,1,"Commission Members, Cooperating Non-members and participating Territories (CCMs) shall, to the greatest extent practical, implement the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds) if they have not already done so."
2015-03_historical,historical,2,"CCMs shall report to the Commission on their implementation of the IPOA-Seabirds, including, as appropriate, the status of their National Plans of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries.                                                             1 This conservation and management measure will replaces CMM 2012-07 and will come into effect on 1 January 2017; until then, all the provisions of CMM 2012-07 will remain in effect. 2  Adopts, in accordance with Article 5 (e) and 10 (1)(c) of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean the following measures to address seabird bycatch:  South of 30o South 1. CCMs shall require their longline vessels fishing south of 30oS, to use at least two of these three measures: weighted branch lines, night setting and tori lines. Table 1 does not apply south of 30o South. See Annex 1 for specifications of these measures.  North of 23o North 2. CCMs shall require their large-scale longline vessels of 24 meters or more in overall length fishing north of 23oN, to use at least two of the mitigation measures in Table 1, including at least one from Column A. CCMs also shall require their small-scale longline vessels less than 24 meters in overall length fishing north of 23oN, to use at least one of the mitigation measures from Column A in Table 1. See Annex 1 for specifications of these measures.  Table 1: Mitigation measures Column A Column B Side setting with a bird curtain and weighted branch lines2 Tori line3 Night setting with minimum deck lighting Blue-dyed bait Tori line Deep setting line shooter Weighted branch lines Management of offal discharge    Other Areas"
2015-03_historical,historical,3,"In other areas (between 30oS and 23oN), where necessary, CCMs are encouraged to have their longline vessels employ one or more of the seabird mitigation measures listed in Table 1.  General Principles"
2015-03_historical,historical,4,"For research and reporting purposes, each CCM with longline vessels that fish in the Convention Area south of 30°S or north of 23°N shall submit to the Commission in part 2 of its annual report information describing which of the mitigation measures they require their vessels to use, as well as the technical specifications for each of those mitigation measures. Each such CCM shall also include in its annual reports for subsequent years any changes it has made to its required mitigation measures or technical specifications for those measures.                                                             2 If using side setting with a bird curtain and weighted branch lines from Column A, this will be counted as two mitigation measures. 3 If a tori line is selected from both Column A and Column B, this equates to simultaneously using two (i.e. paired) tori lines. 3"
2015-03_historical,historical,5,CCMs are encouraged to undertake research to further develop and refine measures to mitigate seabird bycatch including mitigation measures for use during the setting and hauling process and should submit to the Secretariat for the use by the SC and the TCC any information derived from such efforts. Research should be undertaken in the fisheries and areas to which the measure will be used.
2015-03_historical,historical,6,"The SC and TCC will annually review any new information on new or existing mitigation measures or on seabird interactions from observer or other monitoring programmes. Where necessary, an updated suite of mitigation measures, specifications for mitigation measures, or recommendations for areas of application will then be provided to the Commission for its consideration and review as appropriate."
2015-03_historical,historical,7,CCMs are encouraged to adopt measures aimed at ensuring that seabirds captured alive during longlining are released alive and in as good condition as possible and that wherever possible hooks are removed without jeopardizing the life of the seabird concerned. Research into the survival of released seabirds is encouraged.
2015-03_historical,historical,8,The intersessional working group for the regional observer programme (IWG-ROP) will take into account the need to obtain detailed information on seabird interactions to allow analysis of the effects of fisheries on seabirds and evaluation of the effectiveness of bycatch mitigation measures.
2015-03_historical,historical,9,"CCMs shall annually provide to the Commission, in Part 1 of their annual reports, all available information on interactions with seabirds reported or collected by observers, including mitigation used, observed and reported species specific seabird bycatch rates and numbers, to enable the Scientific Committee to estimate seabird mortality in all fisheries to which the Convention applies. (see Annex 2 for Part 1 reporting template guideline). Alternatively, statistically rigorous estimates of species- specific seabird interaction rates (for longline, interactions per 1,000 hooks) and total numbers should be reported."
2015-03_historical,historical,10,"This Conservation and Management measure replaces CMM 2012-07, which is hereby repealed."
