These management plans must be developed by 1 July 2015, if possible and no later than 1 December 2015 and submitted to the Commission.  These plans must explicitly demonstrate how the fisheries aim to avoid or reduce catch and maximises live release of specimens of highly depleted species such as silky and oceanic whitetip sharks caught incidentally. Those management plans submitted by 1 July shall be provided to the SC11 for review, before discussion at WCPFC 12. Plans submitted up to 1 December 2015 shall be reviewed in the subsequent year at SC12 and WCPFC1"
