2008-05_historical,historical,3,No later than 30 April 2009 CCMs shall nominate the maximum total catch of swordfish that it shall continue to be permitted to fish in the area south of 20°S in 2009.

2008-05_historical,historical,4,The catch limits established under paragraph 2 will apply for 2009.3
2008-05_historical,historical,5,"In order to reconcile significant changes in catch of swordfish south of 20°S by swordfish vessels reported to the Commission, all operational level catch and effort data for swordfish vessels flagged to the relevant CCM shall be subject to an independent catch verification review funded by the CCM to whom the data relates, and carried out in 2009. The verification review will be undertaken by SPC-OFP in cooperation with the flag state’s relevant authority and in accordance with an appropriate confidentiality agreement.  The verification review shall occur in the flag State to whom the data relates. The results of the verification review shall be reported to the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee, and taken into account by the Commission in determining any future catch limits."

Australia’s domestic total allowable catch for swordfish in the Convention Area is limited to 1400 tonnes for 2009. New Zealand’s domestic total allowable commercial catch within its EEZ is currently limited to 885 tonnes. 9. CCMs shall report to the Commission the total number of vessels that fished for swordfish and the total catch of swordfish for the following:  a. vessels flying their flag anywhere in the Convention Area south of 20°S; b. vessels operating in their EEZ south of 20°S under charter, lease or other similar mechanism; and c. any other vessels fishing within their waters south of 20°S.
