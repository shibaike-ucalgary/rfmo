Objective and Scope"
2019-04_historical,historical,2,"The objective of this Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) is, through the application of the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of sharks."
2019-04_historical,historical,3,This CMM shall apply to: (i) sharks listed in Annex 1 of the 1982 Convention and (ii) any other sharks caught in association with fisheries managed under the WCPF Convention.
2019-04_historical,historical,4,This measure shall apply to the high seas and exclusive economic zones of the Convention Area.
2019-04_historical,historical,5,"Nothing in this measure shall prejudice the sovereignty and sovereign rights of coastal States, including for traditional fishing activities and the rights of traditional fishers, to apply alternative measures for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing sharks, including any national plan of action for the conservation and management of sharks, within areas under their national jurisdiction. When Commission Members, Cooperating Non-Members, and Participating Territories (CCMs) apply alternative measures, the CCMs shall annually provide to the Commission, in their Part 2 Annual Report, a description of the measures.  III. FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of sharks"
2019-04_historical,historical,6,"CCMs should implement, as appropriate, the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA).

2019-04_historical,historical,7,CCMs shall take measures necessary to require that all sharks retained on board their vessels are fully utilized. CCMs shall ensure that the practice of finning is prohibited.
2019-04_historical,historical,8,"In order to implement the obligation in paragraph 7, in 2020, 2021 and 2022, CCMs shall require their vessels to land sharks with fins naturally attached to the carcass."
2019-04_historical,historical,9,"Notwithstanding paragraph 8, in 2020, 2021 and 2022, CCMs may take alternative measures as listed below to ensure that individual shark carcasses and their corresponding fins can be easily identified on board the vessel at any time:  (1) Each individual shark carcass and its corresponding fins are stored in the same bag, preferably biodegradable one;  (2) Each individual shark carcass is bound to the corresponding fins using rope or wire;  (3) Identical and uniquely numbered tags are attached to each shark carcass and its corresponding fins in a manner that inspectors can easily identify the matching of the carcass and fins at any time. Both the carcasses and fins shall be stored on board in the same hold.  Notwithstanding this requirement, a CCM may allow its fishing vessels to store the carcasses and corresponding fins in different holds if the fishing vessel maintains a record or logbook that shows where the tagged fins and correspondingly 3  tagged carcasses are stored, in a manner that they are easily identified by inspectors."
2019-04_historical,historical,10,"In case that a CCM wishes to allow its fishing vessels operating on the high seas to use any measure other than the three alternatives in paragraph 9 (1) – (3), it shall present it to TCC. If TCC endorses it, it shall be submitted to the subsequent annual meeting for endorsement."
2019-04_historical,historical,11,"All CCMs shall include in their Part 2 Annual Report information on the implementation of the measures in paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 as applicable for review by TCC. The report by CCMs shall contain a detailed explanation of implementation of paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 as applicable including how compliance has been monitored. CCMs are encouraged to report to TCC any enforcement difficulties that they encountered in the case of the alternative measures and how they have addressed risks such as monitoring at sea, species substitution, etc. The TCC in 2023 shall, taking into account these reports, advise the Commission on the effectiveness of the measures set out in paragraph 9 as alternatives to the obligation contained in paragraph 7, and recommend measures for consideration and possible adoption at the 2023 annual meeting of the Commission."

2019-04_historical,historical,13,"CCMs shall take measures necessary to ensure that both carcasses and their corresponding fins are landed or transshipped together, in a manner that allows inspectors to verify the correspondence between an individual carcass and its fins when they are landed or transshipped.   V. Minimizing bycatch and practicing safe release"
2019-04_historical,historical,14,"For longline fisheries targeting tuna and billfish, CCMs shall ensure that their vessels comply with at least one of the following options: (1) do not use or carry wire trace as branch lines or leaders; or (2) do not use branch lines running directly off the longline floats or drop lines, known as shark lines.

2019-04_historical,historical,17,"The Commission shall adopt and enhance bycatch mitigation measures and develop new or amend, if necessary, existing Shark Safe Release Guidelines1 to maximize the survival of sharks that are caught and are not to be retained. Where sharks are unwanted bycatch they should be released alive using techniques that result in minimal harm, taking into account the safety of the crew. CCMs should encourage their fishing vessels to use any Commission adopted guidelines for  1 The Commission adopted at WCPFC15 Best Handling Practices for the Safe Release of Sharks (other than Whale Sharks and Mantas/Mobulids) 4  the safe release and handling of sharks."
2019-04_historical,historical,18,"CCMs shall ensure that sharks that are caught and are not to be retained, hauled alongside the vessel before being cut free in order to facilitate a species identification.  This requirement shall only apply when an observer or electronic monitoring camera is present, and should only be implemented taking into consideration the safety of the crew and observer."
