2015-06_historical,historical,1,"The target reference point for the WCPO skipjack tuna stock shall initially be 50 per cent of the estimated recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing, (SBF=0, t1-t2)."
2015-06_historical,historical,2,This target reference point shall be an interim target reference point until it is reviewed in accordance with paragraph 8 below.
2015-06_historical,historical,3,"The method to be used in estimating the recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing shall be the same as that adopted by the Commission for the limit reference point for WCPO skipjack tuna, i.e.  a) The time window shall have a length of ten years and be based on the last ten years used in the most recent skipjack stock assessment, i.e. t1=ylast-10 to t2=ylast-1 where ylast is the last year used in the assessment; and b) The estimation shall be based on the most recent skipjack stock assessment model estimates of recruitment that have been adjusted to reflect conditions without fishing according to the stock recruitment relationship."
2015-06_historical,historical,4,Conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission shall aim at maintaining the WCPO skipjack tuna stock at the target reference point level on average.
2015-06_historical,historical,5,The Scientific Committee shall refer to the target reference point in its assessment of the status of the WCPO skipjack tuna stock and in reporting to the Commission on management advice and implications for this stock.
2015-06_historical,historical,6,"The Commission shall use the target reference in the formulation of a harvest control rule and a harvest strategy for fisheries targeting WCPO skipjack tuna in accordance with CMM 2014-06.  The harvest control rule shall be designed such that the management control to be implemented would result in the biomass-based target reference point being achieved on average in the long term, taking account of uncertainty."
2015-06_historical,historical,7,"The Commission shall consider and pay particular attention to any future recommendations of the Scientific Committee relating to the target reference point, including any recommendations with respect to potential spatial impacts of fishing on the stock, including possible local depletion or range contraction."
2015-06_historical,historical,8,"The target reference point shall be reviewed by the Commission no later than 2019, and may be reviewed at any time relevant new information is made available, such as any time a new stock assessment is prepared. "
