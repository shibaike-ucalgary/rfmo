2008-03_historical,historical,1,"Commission Members, Cooperating non-Members and participating Territories (CCMs) will implement, as appropriate the FAO Guidelines to Reduce Sea Turtle Mortality in Fishing Operations and to ensure the safe handling of all captured sea turtles, in order to improve their survival."
2008-03_historical,historical,2,"Beginning in 2009, CCMs shall report to the Commission in Part 2 of their annual reports the progress of implementation of the FAO Guidelines and this measure, including information collected on interactions with sea turtles in fisheries managed under the Convention."
2008-03_historical,historical,3,"All data collected by the WCPFC Regional Observer Program (ROP), shall be reported to the Commission as provided in paragraph 2 above or as agreed to under other Commission data collection provisions."
2008-03_historical,historical,4,"CCMs shall require fishermen on vessels targeting species covered by the Convention to bring aboard, if practicable, any captured hard-shell sea turtle that is comatose or inactive as soon as possible and foster its recovery, including giving it resuscitation, before returning it to the water. CCMs shall ensure that fishermen are aware of and use proper mitigation and handling techniques, as described in WCPFC guidelines to be developed and provided to all CCMs by the Secretariat."
2008-03_historical,historical,5,"CCMs with purse seine vessels that fish for species covered by the Convention shall:  a. Ensure that operators of such vessels, while fishing in the Convention Area:  i. To the extent practicable, avoid encirclement of sea turtles, and if a sea turtle is encircled or entangled, take practicable measures to safely release the turtle.    3ii. To the extent practicable, release all sea turtles observed entangled in fish aggregating devices (FADs) or other fishing gear.  iii. If a sea turtle is entangled in the net, stop net roll as soon as the turtle comes out of the water; disentangle the turtle without injuring it before resuming the net roll; and to the extent practicable, assist the recovery of the turtle before returning it to the water.   iv. Carry and employ dip nets, when appropriate, to handle turtles.  b. Require that operators of such vessels record all incidents involving sea turtles during fishing operations and report such incidents to the appropriate authorities of the CCM.   c. Provide the results of the reporting under paragraph 5(b) to the Commission as part of the reporting requirement of paragraph 2.  d. Provide to the Commission the results of any research related to the development of modified FAD designs to reduce sea turtle entanglement and take measures to encourage the use of designs found to be successful at such reduction."
2008-03_historical,historical,6,"CCMs with longline vessels that fish for species covered by the Convention shall ensure that the operators of all such longline vessels carry and use line cutters and de-hookers to handle and promptly release sea turtles caught or entangled, and that they do so in accordance with WCPFC guidelines that are to be developed and provided to all CCMs by the Secretariat. CCMs shall also ensure that operators of such vessels are, where appropriate, required to carry and use dip-nets in accordance with these WCPFC guidelines."
2008-03_historical,historical,7,"Starting on 1 January 2010, CCMs with longline vessels that fish for swordfish in a shallow-set manner1 shall:  a. Ensure that the operators of such vessels, while in the Convention Area, are required to employ or implement at least one of the following three methods to mitigate the capture of sea turtles:  i. Use only large circle hooks, which are fishing hooks that are generally circular or oval in shape and originally designed and manufactured so that the point is turned perpendicularly back to the shank. These hooks shall have an offset not to exceed 10 degrees.  ii. Use only whole finfish for bait.  iii. Use any other measure, mitigation plan2 or activity that has been reviewed by the Scientific Committee (SC) and the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC)                                                  1 “Shallow-set” fisheries are generally to be considered those in which the majority of hooks fish at a depth shallower than 100 meters; however, pursuant to paragraph 7(c) CCMs are to establish and enforce their own operational definitions.   4and approved by the Commission to be capable of reducing the interaction rate (observed numbers per hooks fished) of turtles in swordfish shallow-set longline fisheries.  b. The requirements of paragraph 7(a) need not be applied to those shallow-set swordfish longline fisheries determined by the SC, based on information provided by the relevant CCM, to have minimal3 observed interaction rates of sea turtles over a three-year period and a level of observer coverage of at least 10% during each of those three years.   c. For the purpose of implementing this paragraph (7), establish and enforce their own operational definitions of shallow-set swordfish longline fisheries, large circle hooks, and any measures under 7(a)(iii) or adopted by the Commission under paragraph 12, ensuring that they are as enforceable as possible, and report these definitions to the Commission in Part 2 of their annual reports.  d. Provide for their longline vessels to record all incidents involving sea turtles during fishing operations and report such incidents to the appropriate authorities of the CCM.  e. Provide the results of the reporting under paragraph 7(d) to the Commission as part of the reporting requirement of paragraph 2."
2008-03_historical,historical,8,"CCMs with longline fisheries other than shallow-set swordfish fisheries are urged to:   a. Undertake research trials of circle hooks and other mitigation methods in those longline fisheries.   b. Report the results of these trials to the SC and TCC, at least 60 days in advance of the annual meetings of these subsidiary bodies."
2008-03_historical,historical,9,"The SC and TCC will annually review the information reported by CCMs pursuant to this measure. Where necessary an updated suite of mitigation measures, specifications for mitigation measures, or recommendations for their application will be developed by these committees and provided to the Commission for its consideration and review."
2008-03_historical,historical,10,This measure authorizes the Secretariat to obligate resources available to the Special Requirements Fund to be used to assist developing State Members and Territories in implementing the FAO Guidelines to Reduce Sea Turtle Mortality. These funds can be used to train and encourage fishers to adopt appropriate methods and technologies to reduce interactions with sea turtles and to mitigate their adverse effects.
2008-03_historical,historical,11,"The Commission urges CCMs to contribute to the Special Requirements Fund to support eligible members in their efforts to implement this measure, or to provide such support through bilateral arrangements.                                                                                                                                                                2 A mitigation plan details the actions that will be taken to achieve specified reductions in sea turtle interactions. 3 To be determined by SC5.    5"
2008-03_historical,historical,12,"The Commission will regularly consider additional or new mitigation measures for other longline and purse seine fisheries, based on advice from the SC and TCC and on information provided by CCMs pursuant to this measure."
2008-03_historical,historical,13," The Secretariat, in coordination with interested CCMs, shall develop guidelines for the handling of sea turtles and distribute them to CCMs no later than June 30, 2009."
2008-03_historical,historical,14,"Nothing in this measure shall prejudice the sovereignty and sovereign rights of coastal States, including for traditional fishing activities and the rights of traditional artisanal fishers, to apply alternative measures for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing sea turtles, including any national plans of action for the conservation and management of sea turtles, within areas under their national jurisdiction."
