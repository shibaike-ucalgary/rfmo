2014-06_historical,historical,1,To agree that the Commission shall develop and implement a harvest strategy approach for each of the key fisheries or stocks under the purview of the Commission according to the process set out in this conservation and management measure (CMM).    General provisions
2014-06_historical,historical,2,"A harvest strategy is a framework that specifies the pre-determined management actions in a fishery for defined species (at the stock or management unit level) necessary to achieve agreed biological, ecological, economic and/or social management objectives."
2014-06_historical,historical,3,"The Commission agrees that harvest strategies established pursuant to this CMM may be developed for a fishery that targets or catches either a single, or a number of, species (at the stock or management unit level) including as incidental catch, or stocks that are harvested by several fisheries.   Harvest Strategy Principles"
2014-06_historical,historical,4,"Harvest strategies are considered to represent a best-practice approach to fisheries management decision making. Harvest strategies are proactive, adaptive and provide a framework for taking the best available information about a stock or fishery and applying an evidence and risk-based approach to setting harvest levels. They provide a more certain operating environment where management decisions relating to the fishery or stocks are more consistent, predictable and transparent."
2014-06_historical,historical,6,"In developing individual harvest strategies for fisheries or stocks within the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, the Commission shall have regard to the principles set out in the Convention, in particular Articles 5 and 6.  Elements of a harvest strategy"
2014-06_historical,historical,7,"   7. Each harvest strategy developed in accordance with this CMM shall, wherever possible and where appropriate, contain the following elements:  a. Defined operational objectives, including timeframes, for the fishery or stock (‘management objectives’)  b. Target and limit reference points for each stock (‘reference points’)  3  c. Acceptable levels of risk of not breaching limit reference points (‘acceptable levels of risk’)  d. A monitoring strategy using best available information to assess performance against reference points (‘monitoring strategy’)  e. Decision rules that aim to achieve the target reference point and aim to avoid the limit reference point  (‘harvest control rules’), and  f. An evaluation of the performance of the proposed harvest control rules against management objectives, including risk assessment (‘management strategy evaluation’)."
2014-06_historical,historical,8,Further detail on each of these elements is set out in Annex 1 of this CMM.
2014-06_historical,historical,9,"Notwithstanding paragraphs 7 and 8 of this CMM, in developing individual harvest strategies, the Commission may tailor elements on a case by case basis to suit the specific requirements of a particular fishery or stock. This may include agreeing to interim or provisional elements of a harvest strategy. The absence of appropriate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to adopt harvest strategies."
2014-06_historical,historical,10,"In developing individual harvest strategies, the Commission shall take into account and apply Article 8 of the Convention, on compatibility of conservation and management measures on harvest strategies and elements thereof that have already been implemented in the region.   Special requirements of Developing States"
2014-06_historical,historical,11,"In recognition of the special requirements of Developing States Parties to this Convention, in particular Small Island Developing States and of Territories and Possessions, in relation to conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, the Commission will facilitate the effective participation of these States, Territories and Possessions in Commission meetings and those of its subsidiary bodies undertaking work on harvest strategies, and will apply the provisions of Article 30(2) of the Convention in the development of CMMs resulting from that work."
2014-06_historical,historical,12,"Harvest strategies shall not result in transferring, directly or indirectly, a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto developing States Parties, and territories and possessions.  Timelines for the adoption of harvest strategies"
2014-06_historical,historical,13,"The Commission shall agree a workplan and indicative timeframes to adopt or refine harvest strategies for skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin, South Pacific albacore, Pacific bluefin and northern albacore1 tuna by no later than the twelfth meeting of the Commission in 2015. This workplan will be subject to review in 2017. The Commission may agree timeframes to adopt harvest strategies for other fisheries or stocks.   Resources"
2014-06_historical,historical,14,"In formulating their budget and work programme, the Commission, Scientific Committee and any relevant WCPFC sub-committees are expected to ensure that the tasks listed in this measure are                                                            1 Draft timeframes and harvest strategies for stocks which occur mostly in the area north of 20N to be developed and recommended by the Northern Committee. 4  sufficiently resourced in terms of time and budget to achieve the agreed timeframes."
2014-06_historical,historical,15,The Commission may draw on funds earmarked for this purpose from the Voluntary Contributions Fund to achieve the tasks listed in this measure.
2014-06_historical,historical,16,"In the interests of efficiency and ensuring full participation by all CCMs, the Commission may decide to use existing WCPFC meetings to undertake the work set out in this CMM or convene additional workshops or meetings to consider the tasks set out in this CMM.  "
