2008-01_historical,historical,1," The objectives of this Measure are to:    � Ensure through the implementation of compatible measures for the high seas and EEZs that bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks are maintained at levels capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield; as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors including the special requirements of developing States in the Convention area as expressed by Article 5 of the Convention.                                                   1 For the purposes of these measures, the term Fish Aggregation Device (FAD) means any man-made device, or natural floating object, whether anchored or not, that is capable of aggregating fish.   3� Achieve, through the implementation of a package of measures, over a three-year period commencing in 2009, a minimum of 30% reduction in bigeye tuna fishing mortality from the annual average during the period 2001-2004 or 2004;    � Ensure that there is no increase in fishing mortality for yellowfin tuna beyond the annual average during the period 2001-2004 average or 2004; and  � Adopt a package of measures that shall be reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary by the Commission taking account of the scientific advice available at the time as well as the implementation of the measures.  In addition, this review shall include any adjustments required by Commission decisions regarding management objectives and reference points.    GENERAL RULES OF APPLICATION"
2008-01_historical,historical,2," For the purposes of these measures, vessels operated under charter, lease or other similar mechanisms by developing islands States and participating territories, as an integral part of their domestic fleet, shall be considered to be vessels of the host island State or territory.  Such charter, lease or other similar mechanism shall be conducted in a manner so as not to charter known illegal, unreported and unregulated  (IUU) vessels. The Commission shall consider the implementation of a Charter Arrangements Scheme at its 6th Session in 2009."
2008-01_historical,historical,3," In giving effect to CMM 2004-02, the  Commission  shall advise non-Parties to the Convention wishing to acquire Co-operating Non member (CNM) status that there is a high probability that overfishing is currently taking place in respect of bigeye and yellowfin and tuna in the Convention Area.  Therefore, where necessary, the limits that apply to CNMs, particularly on the high seas, will be determined by the Commission in accordance with CMM 2004-02 or its revision."
2008-01_historical,historical,4, The Commission will not delay the adoption of precautionary measures while research to reduce the fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna is being undertaken by CCMs.
2008-01_historical,historical,5, The Commission encourages CCMs to ensure that the effectiveness of these measures is not undermined by a transfer of effort into archipelagic waters and territorial seas.
2008-01_historical,historical,6," Unless otherwise stated, nothing in this measure shall prejudice the legitimate rights and obligations of those small island developing State Members and participating territories in the Convention Area seeking to develop their own domestic fisheries."
2008-01_historical,historical,7,"In the determination of levels of effort for the purpose of implementing this Measure current levels of fishing effort shall include, as applicable, fishing rights organized under existing regional or bilateral fisheries partnership arrangements or agreements previously registered with the Commission by December 2006 in accordance with CMM2005-01, provided that the number of licences authorized under such arrangements does not increase and noting that the registration of bilateral agreements or arrangements does not provide a basis for establishing effort levels on the high seas.  PURSE SEINE FISHERY"
2008-01_historical,historical,8," The purse seine fishery provisions of this Measure herein apply to the Convention Area bounded by 20ºN and 20ºS with the objective of achieving over a 3-year period commencing   4from the date this measure comes into effect in 2009, a 30% reduction in fishing mortality on bigeye tuna in the purse seine fishery in that area and a reduction in the risk of overfishing yellowfin tuna."
2008-01_historical,historical,9," CCMs shall ensure that the effectiveness of these measures for the purse seine fishery are not undermined by a transfer of effort in days fished into areas within the Convention Area south of 20ºS. In order to not undermine the effectiveness of these measures, CCMs shall not transfer fishing effort in days fished in the purse seine fishery to areas within the Convention Area north of 20ºN."
2008-01_historical,historical,10,"CCMs shall take necessary measures to ensure that the level of purse seine fishing effort in days fished2 by their vessels in areas of the high seas does not exceed 2004 levels or the average of 2001-2004. In accordance with paragraph 6 this Measure, this paragraph shall not apply to small developing state members and participating territories.  Measures for 2009  EEZ and High Seas"
2008-01_historical,historical,11,"For the members of the FFA who belong to the PNA, this measure will be implemented through their domestic processes and legislation, including the Vessel Day (VDS) Scheme which limits total days fished in the EEZs of PNA members to no greater than 2004 levels (Attachment C). The purse seine fishery in EEZs in the area bounded by 20ºN and 20ºS shall be closed to fishing on FADs between 0000 hours on 1 August and 2400 hours on 30 September. During this period all purse seine vessels required to carry an observer from the Regional Observer Program on board, and without such an observer on board, will cease fishing and return directly to port. During this period, a vessel may only engage in fishing operations if the vessel carries on board an observer from the Regional Observer Program to monitor that at no time does the vessel deploy or service any FAD or associated electronic devices or fish on schools in association with FADs."
2008-01_historical,historical,12, Other non-PNA CCMs shall implement compatible measures to reduce purse seine fishing mortality on bigeye tuna in their EEZs.

During this period all purse seine vessels without an observer from the Regional Observer Program on board will cease fishing and return directly to port. During this period, a vessel may only engage in fishing operations if the vessel carries on board an observer from the Regional Observer Program to monitor that at no time does the vessel deploy or service any FAD or associated electronic devices or fish on schools in association with FADs."
2008-01_historical,historical,14," Vessels seeking an observer from the Regional Observer Program for the period of the closures identified in paragraphs 12 and 13 above shall notify the Regional Observer Program Coordinator 21 days in advance. If the lack of an available observer from the Regional Observer Program would prevent a vessel from being able to fish during the period in question, the flag State may place an observer from its national program on the vessel to monitor compliance with                                                  2 In the case of small developing fleets, of four vessels or less, that legitimately entered the fishery after 2000 but before 2004, the baseline level of effort shall be a year in the period 2001-2004 in which its full vessel complement was active in the fishery.   5these measures with approval from the Regional Observer Program Coordinator and, in respect to fishing in EEZs, the approval of the relevant national authority.  High Seas Alternative to Paragraph 13 (Catch Limits)"
2008-01_historical,historical,15,"As an alternative to the high seas FAD closure established pursuant to paragraph 13, Members may adopt measures to reduce their catch by weight of bigeye tuna in the purse seine fishery in the area between 20°N and 20°S by a minimum of 10 percent relative to 2001-2004 average levels through a Member-specific catch limit to achieve this goal.  This alternative shall only be available to Members identified by the Commission in advance as having demonstrated a functioning capacity to implement such measures in an effective and transparent manner, including through: an established and functioning port monitoring program that allows monitoring of bigeye landings for each trip by each vessel; a commitment to carry on board observers from the Regional Observer Program, including upon return to port so that the observer can view the port monitoring program for each trip; a commitment to provide data for each trip by each vessel to the Commission within 30 days from the completion of the trip; having provided operational catch and effort data at least for the period 2001 to 2004 to substantiate the base level catch and effort; other such conditions as the Commission may determine.  Any such program will be open to audit by the Commission to review the effectiveness of the program."
2008-01_historical,historical,16,"Once identified by the Commission as having met the requirements outlined above, the Members in question shall submit the full details of their intended measures and their port monitoring program to the Commission by 31 January 2009.  The Commission will review these submissions and take them into account when assessing the effectiveness of the measures.   Measures for 2010-2011  EEZs  Waters under the jurisdiction of PNA members"
2008-01_historical,historical,17," For the members of the FFA who are members of the PNA, this measure will be implemented through their domestic processes and legislation, including: a. the VDS which limits total days fished in the EEZs of PNA members to no greater than 2004 levels (Attachment C); and b. the Third Arrangement Implementing the Nauru Agreement of May 2008 which comprises a 3 month FAD closure period in the EEZs of the PNA member countries from 0000 hours on 1 July each year until 2400 hours on 30 September each year; full catch retention and other conditions for the purse seine fleet in national waters.    Waters under the jurisdiction of non-PNA members"
2008-01_historical,historical,18, Other non-PNA CCMs shall implement compatible measures to reduce purse seine fishing mortality on bigeye tuna in their EEZs.   High Seas
2008-01_historical,historical,19," The purse seine fishery on the high seas in the area bounded by 20ºN and 20ºS shall be closed to fishing on FADs between 0000 hours on 1 July and 2400 hours on 30 September. During this period all purse seine vessels without an observer from the Regional Observer Program on board will cease fishing and return directly to port. During this period, a vessel may   6only engage in fishing operations if the vessel carries on board an observer from the Regional Observer Program to monitor that at no time does the vessel deploy or service any FAD or associated electronic devices or fish on schools in association with FADs."
2008-01_historical,historical,20, Alternative measures may be set to reduce bigeye catch by a further 20% as a result of the review by the Commission of the 2009 alternative measure.
2008-01_historical,historical,21," The Commission shall consider the development of a high seas vessel day scheme (HS VDS) to be compatible with the PNA VDS to provide a common currency for managing purse seine effort. Based on the advice and recommendations of the SC and TCC, the Commission shall consider such a scheme at its annual session in 2009 with a view to adoption at its annual session in 2010 with a view to ensuring that reductions in fishing effort on the high seas and in adjacent EEZs are compatible."
2008-01_historical,historical,22,The high seas pockets indicated in Attachment D will be closed effective from 1 January 2010 unless the Commission decides otherwise at its 6th annual meeting in December 2009. At this meeting the Commission will also consider the closure of all high seas pockets in the Convention Area between 20 north and 20 south.   FAD Management Plans
2008-01_historical,historical,23,"By 1 July 2009, CCMs fishing on the high seas shall submit to the Commission Management Plans for the use of FADs by their vessels on the high seas.  These Plans shall include strategies to limit the capture of small bigeye and yellowfin tuna associated with fishing on FADs, including implementation of the FAD closure pursuant to paragraphs 13 and 19 above.

2008-01_historical,historical,25,"The Commission will work with CCMs, regional tuna commissions and industry to develop and implement a 3 year program to explore methods to reduce catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna caught in association with FADs."
2008-01_historical,historical,26,"CCMs, working independently or collaboratively with industry, and reporting through the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee at each regular session, shall explore and evaluate mitigation measures for juvenile bigeye and yellowfin taken around FADs and present the results annually to the Commission.   Catch Retention"
2008-01_historical,historical,27," In order to create a disincentive to the capture of small fish and to encourage the   7development of technologies and fishing strategies designed to avoid the capture of small bigeye and yellowfin tuna, CCMs shall require their purse seine vessels fishing in EEZs and on the high seas within the area bounded by 20ºN and 20ºS from 1 January 2010, subject to the Commission implementing the program in Paragraph 28 for 100 percent coverage on purse seine vessels by the observers from the Regional Observer Program, to retain on board and then land or transship at port all bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna. The provisions of this paragraph, shall not prevent the PNA from implementing the catch retention requirement in their EEZs in accordance with the Third Implementing Agreement. The only exceptions shall be:   a) when, in the final set of a trip, there is insufficient well space to accommodate all fish caught in that set noting that excess fish taken in the last set may be transferred to and retained on board another purse seine vessel provided this is not prohibited under applicable national law; or  b) when the fish are unfit for human consumption for reasons other than size; or c) when serious malfunction of equipment occurs.     Monitoring"
2008-01_historical,historical,28," Purse seine vessels fishing within the area bounded by 200N and 200S exclusively on the high seas, on the high seas and in waters under the jurisdiction of one or more coastal States, or vessels fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of two or more coastal States, shall carry effective 1 January 2010, an observer from the Commission’s Regional Observer Programme."
2008-01_historical,historical,29," In 2009 vessels fishing in the area described above will carry observers compliant with licensing arrangements and on the high seas will have a minimum of 20% observer coverage drawn from the Regional Observer Program. The level of coverage achieved will be monitored and reported through TCC. The Secretariat, in conjunction with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), will develop a cross-endorsement arrangement in order to allow vessels operating within IATTC and Commission  areas on the same fishing trip to use the same observer.   Other Considerations for Purse Seine Measures"
2008-01_historical,historical,30,"Developing skipjack purse seine fisheries, between 20ºN and 20ºS that can provide verifiable evidence of minimal yellowfin and bigeye by-catch (cumulative <2%), with 100% observer coverage, and with a legitimate development plan, will be exempted.  Any such plan shall restrict the use of FADs and implement other such management measures necessary to minimize impacts on bigeye and yellowfin tunas.  These measures must be supported by adequate monitoring, control and surveillance to ensure their effective implementation.  Existing plans shall be tabled at the Commission for information.  The Commission is to be given the opportunity to comment on the plan before its approval. This measure does not apply to the domestic purse seine fisheries of small island developing states.   LONGLINE FISHERY"
2008-01_historical,historical,31,"The total catch of bigeye tuna by longline fishing gear will be subject to a phased reduction such that by 1 January 2012 the longline catch of bigeye tuna is 70% of the average annual catch in 2001-2004 or 2004 (Attachment F).3 The catch of yellowfin tuna is not to be increased in the longline fishery from the 2001-2004 levels.                                                  3 The year 2004 shall apply only to China, the United States and Indonesia.    8"
2008-01_historical,historical,32,"Paragraph 31 does not apply to members and participating territories that caught less than 2,000 tonnes in 2004. Each member that caught less than 2,000 tonnes of bigeye in 2004 shall ensure that their catch does not exceed 2,000 tonnes in each of the next 3 years (2009, 2010 and 2011).  Consistent with paragraph 3 opportunities for non members will be decided by the Commission on a case by case basis."
2008-01_historical,historical,33,"Each member or cooperating non-Member that caught an average of more than 2,000 tonnes of bigeye shall be subject to the following catch limits for bigeye tuna for the years 2009 to 2011 inclusive:    2009: 10% reduction of the catch specified in Attachment F;  2010: 20% reduction of the catch specified in Attachment F;  2011: 30% reduction of the catch specified in Attachment F."
2008-01_historical,historical,34," In accordance with paragraph 6, the limits for bigeye tuna established in paragraphs 31 to 33 above, shall not apply to small island developing State members and participating territories in the Convention Area undertaking responsible development of their domestic fisheries."
2008-01_historical,historical,35," Further to paragraph 34, the reductions specified in paragraph 33 for 2010 and 2011 shall not apply to fleets of members with a total longline bigeye tuna catch limit as stipulated in Attachment F of less than 5,000 tonnes and landing exclusively fresh fish, provided that the details of such fleets and their operational characteristics are registered with the Commission by 31 December 2008 and that the number of licenses authorized in such fisheries does not increase from current levels. In such cases, catch limits specified in Attachment F shall continue to be applied."
2008-01_historical,historical,36,The catch limit for China for 2009 and 2010 will remain at 2004 levels pending agreement being reached to develop an arrangement for the attribution of Chinese catch taken as part of domestic fisheries in the EEZs of Pacific Island Countries.
