CMM,Status,Section Number,Content
2015-01_historical,historical,1," Compatible measures for the high seas and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) are implemented so that bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna stocks are, at a minimum, maintained at levels capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors including the special requirements of 3  developing States in the Convention Area as expressed by Article 5 of the Convention.  The Commission will amend, or replace the objectives with target reference points after their adoption. Skipjack"
2015-01_historical,historical,2," the Fishing Mortality Rate (F) for skipjack will be maintained at a level no greater than Fmsy, i.e. F/Fmsy ≤ 1.  Bigeye"
2015-01_historical,historical,3," the fishing mortality rate for bigeye tuna will be reduced to a level no greater than Fmsy, i.e. F/Fmsy ≤ 1. This objective shall be achieved through step by step approach through 2017 in accordance with this Measure.  Yellowfin"
2015-01_historical,historical,4," the fishing mortality rate is not greater than Fmsy, i.e. F/Fmsy ≤ 1.  General Rules Attribution of Charter Arrangements"
2015-01_historical,historical,5," For the purposes of paragraph 9, 10, 16-18, 25, 28, 40, 43, 49, 50, 51, and 52, attribution of catch and effort shall be to the flag State, except that catches and effort of vessels notified as chartered under CMM 2011-05 shall be attributed to the chartering Member, or Participating Territory. Attribution for the purpose of this Measure is without prejudice to attribution for the purposes of establishing rights and allocation.   Non-Parties"
2015-01_historical,historical,6," In giving effect to CMM 2009-11 or its replacement the Commission shall advise non-Parties to the Convention wishing to acquire Co-operating Non Member (CNM) status as follows: (a) that for bigeye tuna the current fishing mortality rate is above that associated with MSY and the Scientific Committee recommends a reduction in F for bigeye tuna; (b) yellowfin tuna is not being overfished but current F is close to Fmsy and the Scientific Committee recommends no increase in F for yellowfin tuna; (c) that skipjack tuna is not being overfished and that the Scientific Committee recommended that the Commission consider adopting limits on fishing for skipjack tuna and noted that additional purse seine effort on skipjack tuna will yield only modest long term gains in catches. Therefore, where necessary, the limits that apply to CNMs, particularly on the high seas, will be determined by the Commission in accordance with CMM 2009-11 or its revision.    4  Small Island Developing States"
2015-01_historical,historical,7," Unless otherwise stated, nothing in this Measure shall prejudice the rights and obligations of those small island developing State Members and Participating Territories in the Convention Area seeking to develop their domestic fisheries.

2015-01_historical,historical,8," In giving effect to this CMM, the Commission shall pay attention to the geographical situation of a small island developing State which is made up of non-contiguous groups of islands having a distinct economic and cultural identity of their own but which are separated by areas of high seas. Transfer of effort"
2015-01_historical,historical,9," CCMs shall ensure that the effectiveness of these measures for the purse seine fishery are not undermined by a transfer of effort in days fished into areas within the Convention Area south of 20S. In order not to undermine the effectiveness of these measures, CCMs shall not transfer fishing effort in days fished in the purse seine fishery to areas within the Convention Area north of 20N."
2015-01_historical,historical,10, CCMs shall ensure that the effectiveness of other measures of the Commission is not undermined by a transfer of longline fishing effort or capacity to other areas within the Convention Area.  Area of Application

2015-01_historical,historical,12, Coastal States are encouraged to take measures to reduce fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna in archipelagic waters and territorial seas and to notify/inform the WCPFC Secretariat of the relevant measures that they will apply in these waters including longline bigeye catch limits and expected number of FAD sets or bigeye catches from purse seining.  Overlap Area
2015-01_historical,historical,13," The catch and effort limits in paragraphs 16 - 18 (FAD sets), paragraph 25 (high seas purse seine effort limits), paragraph 40 (bigeye longline catch), and paragraphs 28 and 43 (yellowfin purse seine effort and longline catch) shall be calculated from the relevant historical levels within the Convention Area except for those Member flag 5  States who, consistent with the WCPFC9 decision (paragraph 80 of WCPFC9 Summary Report), notify of their choice to implement IATTC measures in the overlap area. For those Member flag States who choose to implement IATTC measures in the overlap area, the calculation of their limits for the Convention Area (excluding the overlap area) shall exclude historical catch or effort within the overlap area. Notwithstanding decisions on application of catch and/or effort limits, all other provisions of this measure apply to all vessels fishing in the overlap area. II.

When a SIDS CCM chooses limitation of annual FAD sets stipulated in paragraphs 16 - 18, purse seine vessels newly introduced after January 1 2010 are managed outside of the FAD set limit for that CCM for 3 years following their introduction.  After 3 years the FAD sets/total sets by those vessels shall be incorporated into the calculation of the baseline figure for that CCM.  Those purse seine vessels exempted or managed outside the FAD set limit shall be notified to the Secretariat by 31 March 2014 or within 15 days of vessels introduced after this date.  6  limit the total number of FAD sets by its vessels to the number listed in column A in Attachment A.4      Additional FAD Measures for 2015 and 2016"

2015-01_historical,historical,19," CCMs that select an option that limits the number of FAD sets in addition to the 3-month prohibition of FAD sets (paragraph 16b, 17b) shall implement the limit on FAD sets in accordance with the following: (a)  The captain of a purse seine vessel shall weekly report (i) the number of FAD sets, (ii) the number of total sets, and (iii) estimated bigeye catch in the previous week to the flag CCM and the observer on board.   (b)  The flag CCM shall provide information set forth in (19a) every month by its vessels to the Secretariat.                                                     4 Throughout this measure, in the case of small purse seine fleets, of five vessels or less, the baseline level of effort used to determine a limit shall be the maximum effort in any period and not the average.   5 The high seas FAD closure in paragraph 18 does not apply in 2017 to a CCM that has achieved a verifiable reduction in bigeye catches by its purse seine vessels to 55% from current levels (2010-2012), to be reviewed on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee.  The measures that the Philippines will take are in Attachment C. 7  (c)  After the number of FAD set conducted reaches 80% of the set limit, the CCM shall report the information (19a) above weekly to the Secretariat.  (d)  After the number of FAD sets conducted reaches 90% of the set limit, the captain shall report the information daily to the flag CCM authority.
