2022-01_active,active,1,"The objective of the interim Management Procedure (MP) for skipjack tuna, is to ensure that: a) the spawning potential depletion1 ratio of skipjack tuna is maintained on average at a level consistent with the target reference point; and       b) the spawning potential depletion ratio of skipjack tuna is maintained above the limit reference point with a risk of the limit reference point being breached no greater than 20 percent;    in a manner that achieves the objective of relative stability in fishing levels between management periods and in the longer term.          Reference Points"
2022-01_active,active,2,"The reference points are:  a) Target reference point: Calculated on the basis of two spawning potential depletion values: • The first value represents the estimated average depletion of the skipjack tuna stock over the  period 2018-2021 (SB2018-2021/SBF=0).   • The second value represents the long-term median equilibrium stock depletion that would be reached under the agreed baseline fishing conditions for skipjack tuna (purse seine effort at 2012 levels, pole and line effort at average 2001-04 levels, and the domestic fisheries in assessment region 5 at average 2016-18 levels). Both values are expressed as a percentage of the estimated average spawning potential in the absence of fishing (SBF=0), calculated as described in paragraph"
2022-01_active,active,3,"Values are calculated as medians based upon the grid of assessment models as agreed by the WCPFC Scientific Committee. The target reference point is the average of these two values (weighting of 50/50). -  1 Spawning potential depletion refers to the estimated spawning potential as a percentage of the estimated spawning potential in the absence of fishing (i.e. the unfished spawning potential). The metric is dynamic and is estimated for each model time step. 1  b) Limit reference point: 20 percent of the estimated recent average spawning potential in the absence of fishing, calculated as described in paragraph 3.  3. The method to be used in calculating spawning potential in the absence of fishing (SBF=0) shall be:  a) SBF=0, t1-t2 is the average of the estimated spawning potential in the absence of fishing for a time window of ten years based on the most recent skipjack tuna stock assessment, where t1=y-10 to t2=y-1 where y is the year under consideration; and  b) The estimation shall be based on the relevant estimates of recruitment that have been adjusted to reflect conditions without fishing according to the stock recruitment relationship.  Scope of the MP"
2022-01_active,active,4,"The MP applies to the catch and effort of purse seine and pole and line fisheries, and other commercial fisheries referred to in paragraph 47 of CMM 2021-01 taking more than 2,000 tonnes of tropical tunas (bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack) in the Exclusive Economic Zones and high seas.            Elements of the MP"
2022-01_active,active,5,"The MP includes: a) The Harvest Control Rule set out in Annex I; b) The Estimation Model using the settings set out in Annex II; c) Data Requirements and the Monitoring Strategy set out in Annex III; d) The procedure for Exceptional Circumstances set out in Annex IV; and e) The provision for Special Circumstances set out in Annex V. Roles of the Commission, the Scientific Committee and the Scientific Services Provider"
2022-01_active,active,6,"The Scientific Committee shall regularly review the performance and outputs of the MP, including the indicators set out in Annex III, and provide advice to the Commission on: a) the performance of the MP as a basis for pre-defined rules that manage skipjack tuna in order to achieve biological, ecological, economic and social objectives, including the robustness of the MP to changes in the fishery and any exceptional circumstances consistent with Annex IV; and b) the application of the MP outputs to CMM 2021-01: CMM for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean or any successor Measure (Tropical tuna CMM)."
2022-01_active,active,7,"The Scientific Services Provider shall run the MP, perform the full assessment, and support Scientific Committee and Commission consideration of the MP."
