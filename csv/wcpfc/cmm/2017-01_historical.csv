The only exceptions to this paragraph shall be: a) when, in the final set of a trip, there is insufficient well space to accommodate all fish caught in that set, noting that excess fish taken in the last set may be transferred to and retained on board another purse seine vessel provided this is not prohibited under applicable national law; or b) when the fish are unfit for human consumption for reasons other than size; or c) when serious malfunction of equipment occurs."
