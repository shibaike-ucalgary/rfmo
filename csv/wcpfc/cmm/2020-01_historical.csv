2020-01_historical,historical,1,"    2                                   1  COMMISSION FIFTEENTH REGULAR SESSION Honolulu, Hawaii, USA 10 – 14 December 2018 CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURE FOR BIGEYE, YELLOWFIN AND SKIPJACK TUNA IN THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN Conservation and Management Measure 2018-01*  PREAMBLE  The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC):   Recalling that since 1999, in the Multilateral High Level Conferences, the Preparatory Conferences, and in the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (the Commission), a number of resolutions and Conservation and Management Measures (CMMs) have been developed to prevent or mitigate the overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin tuna and to limit the growth of fishing capacity in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean;   Recalling that the objective of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (the Convention) is to ensure through effective management, the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the highly migratory fish stocks of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean in accordance with the 1982 Convention and the Agreement;  Recalling further the final statement of the Chairman of the Multilateral High Level Conferences in 2000 that: “It is important to clarify, however, that the Convention applies to the waters of the Pacific Ocean. In particular, the western side of the Convention Area is not intended to include waters of South-East Asia which are not part of the Pacific Ocean, nor is it intended to include waters of the South China Sea as this would involve States which are not participants in the Conference” (Report of the Seventh and Final Session, 30th August- 5 September 2000, p.29); Recognizing that the Scientific Committee has determined that the bigeye stock appears not to be experiencing overfishing and is not in an overfished condition and that the fishing mortality of bigeye should not be increased from the current level to maintain current or increased spawning biomass; that the yellowfin stock appears not to be experiencing overfishing and is not in an overfished condition and the current spawning biomass levels should be maintained; and that skipjack is currently moderately exploited, the fishing mortality level is sustainable, and that the spawning biomass be maintained near the target reference point;   * Version issued 2 May 2019  2 Recognizing further the interactions that occur between the fisheries for bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack tuna;  Noting that Article 30(1) of the Convention requires the Commission to give full recognition to the special requirements of developing States that are Parties to the Convention, in particular small island developing States and Territories and possessions, in relation to the conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area and development of fisheries on such stocks, including the provision of financial, scientific, and technological assistance;  Noting further that Article 30(2) of the Convention requires the Commission to take into account the special requirements of developing States, in particular Small Island developing States and Territories. This includes ensuring that conservation and management measures adopted by it do not result in transferring, directly or indirectly, a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto developing States, Parties, and Territories;  Noting that Article 8(1) of the Convention which requires compatibility of conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction;  Recalling Article 8(4) of the Convention which requires the Commission to pay special attention to the high seas in the Convention Area that are surrounded by exclusive economic zones (EEZs);  Noting that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) have adopted and implemented “A Third Arrangement Implementing The Nauru Agreement Setting Forth Additional Terms And Conditions Of Access To The Fisheries Zones Of The Parties”;  Noting further that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement have adopted and implemented a Vessel Day Scheme for the longline fishery, a Vessel Day Scheme for the purse seine fishery and a registry for FADs in the zones of the Parties, and may establish longline effort limits, or equivalent catch limits for longline fisheries within their exclusive economic zones.   Noting furthermore that the Members of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency have indicated their intention to adopt a system of zone-based longline limits to replace the current system of flag-based bigeye catch limits within their EEZs, and a system of zone-based FAD set limits to replace the FAD closure and flag-based FAD set limits in their EEZs;  Acknowledging that the Commission has adopted a limit reference point (LRP) for bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin tuna of 20% of the estimated recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing, and, for skipjack tuna, has also agreed to an interim target reference point (TRP) of 50% of the recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing (CMM 2015-06);   Acknowledging that the Commission has adopted CMM 2014-06 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Fisheries and Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and a Work Plan to guide the development of key components of a Harvest Strategy, including the  3 recording of management objectives, adoption of reference points, and development of harvest control rules;  Adopts in accordance with Article 10 of the Convention, the following Conservation and Management Measure with respect to bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack tuna:   PURPOSE  1. Pending the establishment of harvest strategies, and any implementing CMM, the purpose of this measure is to provide for a robust transitional management regime that ensures the sustainability of bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin tuna stocks.   PRINCIPLES FOR APPLICATION OF THE MEASURE  Compatibility"
2020-01_historical,historical,2,"  For greater certainty, the works to be completed by 2020 shall be deferred to 202  2. Conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin tuna stocks in their entirety. Measures shall ensure, at a minimum, that stocks are maintained at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, pending agreement on target reference points as part of the harvest strategy approach, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors including the special requirements of developing States in the Convention Area as expressed by Article 5 of the Convention.

To the extent possible the use of mesh net should be avoided. If the FAD is covered with mesh net, it must have a stretched mesh size less than 7 cm (2.5 inches) and the mesh net must be well wrapped around the whole raft so that there is no netting hanging below the FAD when it is deployed. • The design of the underwater or hanging part (tail) of the FAD should avoid the use of mesh net. If mesh net is used, it must have a stretched mesh size of less than 7 cm (2.5 inches) or tied tightly in bundles or “sausages” with enough weight at the end to keep the netting taut down in the water column. Alternatively, a single weighted panel (less than 7 cm (2.5 inches) stretched mesh size net or solid sheet such as canvas or nylon) can be used."

2020-01_historical,historical,23,"A flag CCM shall ensure that each of its purse seine vessels shall have deployed at sea, at any one time, no more than 350 drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) with activated instrumented buoys.  An instrumented buoy is defined as a buoy with a clearly marked  7 reference number allowing its identification and equipped with a satellite tracking system to monitor its position. The buoy shall be activated exclusively on board the vessel.  A flag CCM shall ensure that its vessels operating in the waters of a coastal State comply with the laws of that coastal State relating to FAD management, including FAD tracking."

(Paragraphs 8 to 12 of CMM 2009-02 set out the Commission’s rules for catch retention in the high seas.) The only exceptions to this paragraph shall be: a) when, in the final set of a trip, there is insufficient well space to accommodate all fish caught in that set, noting that excess fish taken in the last set may be transferred to and retained on board another purse seine vessel provided this is not prohibited under applicable national law; or b) when the fish are unfit for human consumption for reasons other than size; or c) when serious malfunction of equipment occurs."
