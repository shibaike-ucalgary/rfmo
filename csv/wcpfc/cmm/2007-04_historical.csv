2007-04_historical,historical,1,"Commission Members, Cooperating Non-members and participating Territories (CCMs) shall, to the extent possible, implement the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds) if they have not already done so."
2007-04_historical,historical,2,"CCMs shall report to the Commission on their implementation of the IPOA-Seabirds, including, as appropriate, the status of their National Plans of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries.                                                   1  By adoption of this CMM (CMM-2007-04) the Commission rescinds CMM-2006-02 which has been revised and replaced. Adopts, in accordance with Article 5 (e) and 10( i)(c ) of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean the Commission the following measure to address seabird bycatch:  1. CCMs shall require their longline vessels to use at least two of the mitigation measures in Table 1, including at least one from Column A in areas south of 30 degrees South and north of 23 degrees North.   Table 1: Mitigation measures  Column A  Column B  Side setting with a bird curtain and weighted branch lines2 Tori line3 Night setting with minimum deck lighting Weighted branch lines  Tori line  Blue-dyed bait  Weighted branch lines  Deep setting line shooter   Underwater setting chute   Management of offal discharge   2. In other areas, where necessary, CCMs are encouraged to employ one or more of the seabird mitigation measures listed in Table 1."
2007-04_historical,historical,3,Minimum technical specifications for measures in Table 1 are provided in Annex 1.
2007-04_historical,historical,4,"For research and reporting purposes, each CCM with longline vessels that fish in the Convention Area south of 30°S or north of 23°N shall submit to the Commission in part 2 of its annual report for 2007 (due in 2008) information describing which of the mitigation measures in Table 1 they require or will require their vessels to use, as well as the technical specifications for each of those mitigation measures. Each such CCM shall also include in its annual reports for subsequent years any changes it has made to its required mitigation measures or technical specifications for those measures."
2007-04_historical,historical,5,CCMs are encouraged to undertake research to further develop and refine measures to mitigate seabird bycatch including mitigation measures for use during the hauling process and should submit to the Secretariat for the use by the SC and the TCC any information derived from such efforts. Research should be undertaken in the fisheries and areas to which the measure will be used.
2007-04_historical,historical,6,"The SC and TCC will annually review any new information on new or existing mitigation measures or on seabird interactions from observer or other monitoring programmes. Where necessary, an updated suite of mitigation measures, specifications for mitigation measures, or recommendations for areas of application will then be provided to the Commission for its consideration and review as appropriate.                                                  2 This measure can only be applied in the area north of 23 degrees north until research establishes the utility of this measure in waters south of 30 degrees south. If using side setting with a bird curtain and weighted branch lines from column A this will be counted as two mitigation measures. 3 If tori line is selected from both Column A and Column B this equates to simultaneously using two (i.e. paired) tori lines."
2007-04_historical,historical,7,CCMs are encouraged to adopt measures aimed at ensuring that seabirds captured alive during longlining are released alive and in as good condition as possible and that wherever possible hooks are removed without jeopardizing the life of the seabird concerned.
2007-04_historical,historical,8,The intersessional working group for the regional observer programme (IWG-ROP) will take into account the need to obtain detailed information on seabird interactions to allow analysis of the effects of fisheries on seabirds and evaluation of the effectiveness of by-catch mitigation measures.
2007-04_historical,historical,9,"CCMs shall annually provide to the Commission, in part 1 of their annual reports, all available information on interactions with seabirds, including bycatches and details of species, to enable the Scientific Committee to estimate seabird mortality in all fisheries to which the WCPF Convention applies."
2007-04_historical,historical,10,"Paragraph 1 of this Conservation and Management Measure shall be implemented by CCMs in the following manner:  - In areas south of 30 degrees South, no later than 1 January 2008 in relation to large-scale longline vessels of 24 meters or more in overall length, and no later than 31 January 2009 in relation to smaller longline vessels of less than 24 meters in overall length.  - In areas north of 23 degrees North, and in relation to large-scale longline vessels of 24 meters or more in overall length, no later than 30 June 2008."
2007-04_historical,historical,11,CCMs shall as of 1 January 2007 initiate a process to ensure that vessels flying their flag will be able to comply with the provisions of para 1 within the deadlines referred to in para 10.
2007-04_historical,historical,12,"This Conservation and Management measure replaces Resolution 2005-01, which is hereby repealed."
