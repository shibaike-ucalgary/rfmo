2012-01_historical,historical,1,"compatible measures for the high seas and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) are implemented so that bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna stocks are, at a minimum, maintained at levels capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors including the special requirements of developing States in the Convention Area as expressed by Article 5 of the Convention. The Commission will amend, or replace the objectives with target reference points after their adoption.   Skipjack"

Therefore, where necessary, the limits that apply to CNMs, particularly on the high seas, will be determined by the Commission in accordance with CMM 2009-11 or its revision.   Small Island Developing States"
