2009-06_active,active,29,"CCMs shall only authorize those purse seine vessels that that have received an exemption by the Commission to engage in transhipment outside of port.

2009-06_active,active,32,"All purse seine vessels, including those that receive an exemption to tranship at sea under the process described in paragraphs 26 to 30 shall be prohibited from commencing transhipping on the high seas in the Convention Area.    7  SECTION 2 – TRANSHIPMENT FROM FISHING VESSELS OTHER THAN PURSE SEINE VESSELS"
2009-06_active,active,33,"Transhipment from longline, troll and pole and line fishing vessels in national waters shall be managed in accordance with relevant domestic laws and procedures pursuant to paragraph 4."
2009-06_active,active,34,"There shall be no transhipment on the high seas except where a CCM has determined, in accordance with the guidelines described in paragraph 37 below, that it is impracticable for certain vessels that it is responsible for to operate without being able to tranship on the high seas, and has advised the Commission of such."
2009-06_active,active,35,"Where transhipment does occur on the high seas:  a. the CCMs responsible for reporting against both the offloading and receiving vessels shall, as appropriate:  i. advise the Commission of its procedures for monitoring and verification of the transhipments;  ii. indicate vessels to which the determinations apply. iii. notify the information in Annex III to the Executive Director at least  36 hours prior to each transhipment. iv. provide the Executive Director with a  WCPFC Transhipment Declaration within 15 days of completion of each transhipment; and  v. Submit to the Commission a plan detailing what steps it is taking to encourage transhipment to occur in port in the future."
2009-06_active,active,36,"The Commission, through the TCC, shall review the application of the exemptions by relevant CCMs after a period of 3 years and every 2 years thereafter to establish whether monitoring and verification has been effective.  After review, the Commission may prohibit transhipment on the high seas by any vessel or vessels in relation to which monitoring and verification of transhipment on the high seas is proven to have been ineffective, or establish or vary any conditions for transhipping on the high seas."
2009-06_active,active,37,"The Executive Director shall prepare draft guidelines for the determination of circumstances where it is impracticable for certain vessels to tranship in port or in waters under national jurisdiction. The Technical and Compliance Committee shall consider these guidelines, amend as necessary, and recommend them to the Commission for adoption in 2012. In the meantime, CCMs shall use the following guidelines when determining the practicability of high seas transshipments a. The prohibition of transhipment in the high seas would cause a significant economic hardship, which would be assessed in terms of the cost that would be incurred to transship or land fish at feasible and allowable locations other than on the high seas, as compared to total operating costs, net revenues, or some other meaningful measure of costs and/or revenues; and b. The vessel would have to make significant and substantial changes to its historical 8  mode of operation as a result of the prohibition of transhipment in the high seas;"
2009-06_active,active,38,"When adopting the Guidelines referred to in paragraph 37, the Commission shall consider whether to prohibit transhipment in areas of high seas in the Convention Area entirely surrounded by the exclusive economic zones of members of the Commission and Participating Territories.  This consideration will include a review of the catch and effort reported for fishing vessels in these areas, the information from Transhipment Declarations in these areas and the role of the areas in supporting IUU activities.
