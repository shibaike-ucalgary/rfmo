Objective and Scope"
2022-04_active,active,2,"The objective of this Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) is, through the application of the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of sharks."
2022-04_active,active,3,This CMM shall apply to: (i) sharks listed in Annex 1 of the 1982 Convention and (ii) any other sharks caught in association with fisheries managed under the WCPF Convention.
2022-04_active,active,4,This measure shall apply to the high seas and exclusive economic zones of the Convention Area.
2022-04_active,active,5,"Nothing in this measure shall prejudice the sovereignty and sovereign rights of coastal States, including for traditional fishing activities and the rights of traditional fishers, to apply alternative measures for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing sharks, including any national plan of action for the conservation and management of sharks, within areas under their national jurisdiction. When Commission Members, Cooperating Non-Members, and Participating Territories (CCMs) apply alternative measures, the CCMs shall annually provide to the Commission, in their Part 2 Annual Report, a description of the measures.  III. FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of sharks"
2022-04_active,active,6,"CCMs should implement, as appropriate, the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA).

2022-04_active,active,7,CCMs shall take measures necessary to require that all sharks retained on board their vessels are fully utilized. CCMs shall ensure that the practice of finning is prohibited.
2022-04_active,active,8,"In order to implement the obligation in paragraph 7, in 2022, 2023 and 2024, CCMs shall require their vessels to land sharks with fins naturally attached to the carcass."
2022-04_active,active,9,"Notwithstanding paragraph 8, in 2022, 2023 and 2024, CCMs may take alternative measures as listed below to ensure that individual shark carcasses and their corresponding fins can be easily identified on board the vessel at any time: (1) Each individual shark carcass and its corresponding fins are stored in the same bag, preferably biodegradable one; (2) Each individual shark carcass is bound to the corresponding fins using rope or wire; (3) Identical and uniquely numbered tags are attached to each shark carcass and its corresponding fins in a manner that inspectors can easily identify the matching of the carcass and fins at any time. Both the carcasses and fins shall be stored on board in the same hold.  Notwithstanding this requirement, a CCM may allow its fishing vessels to store the carcasses and corresponding fins in different holds if the fishing vessel maintains a record or logbook that shows where the tagged fins and correspondingly tagged carcasses are stored, in a manner that they are easily identified by inspectors. 3"
2022-04_active,active,10,"In case that a CCM wishes to allow its fishing vessels operating on the high seas to use any measure other than the three alternatives in paragraph 9 (1) – (3), it shall present it to TCC.
