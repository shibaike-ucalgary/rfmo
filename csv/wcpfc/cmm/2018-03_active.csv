2018-03_active,active,1," Commission Members, Cooperating Non-members and participating Territories (CCMs) should, to the greatest extent practical, implement the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds) if they have not already done so."
2018-03_active,active,2," CCMs should report to the Commission on their implementation of the IPOA-Seabirds, including, as appropriate, the status of their National Plans of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries.  Adopts, in accordance with Article 5(e) and 10 (1)(c) of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean the following measures to address seabird bycatch:  South of 30° South  1.  CCMs shall require their longline vessels fishing south of 30°S, to use either  a)  at least two of these three measures:                i).  weighted branch lines;               ii). night setting;              iii).  tori lines; or     b)  hook-shielding devices. Table 1 does not apply south of 30° South.  See Annex 1 for specifications of these measures.  25° South -30° South 2. CCMs shall require their longline vessels fishing in the area 25°S-30°S to use one of the following mitigation measures:   i) weighted branch lines;   ii) tori lines; or   iii) hook-shielding devices.  Table 1 does not apply in the area 25°S-30°S. See Annex 1 for specifications of these measures."
2018-03_active,active,3,The extension of the scope of application of seabird mitigation measures from 30°S to 25°S shall not come into effect until 1 January 2020.
2018-03_active,active,4,"The requirements of paragraph 2 shall not apply in the EEZs of French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands and Fiji due to the low risk to seabirds. Those SIDS and Territories that have vessels operating south of 250 South are encouraged to collect data on seabird interactions, increase observer coverage rate as appropriate, and implement seabird mitigation measures when they operate within their EEZs."
2018-03_active,active,5,"The provisions in this section shall be reviewed no later than 3 years from the implementation date by the SC, based on the best available scientific information. The review shall consider both 3  the efficacy of the mitigation measures being used and the risk to vulnerable seabirds in areas where mitigation measures are not required and make recommendations to the Commission if needed.   North of 23° North"
2018-03_active,active,6," CCMs shall require their large-scale longline vessels of 24 meters or more in overall length fishing north of 23°N, to use at least two of the mitigation measures in Table 1, including at least one from Column A. CCMs also shall require their small-scale longline vessels less than 24  meters  in  overall  length  fishing  north  of  23°N,  to  use  at  least  one  of  the  mitigation measures from Column A in Table 1. See Annex 1 for specifications of these measures.  Table 1: Mitigation measures Column A Column B Side setting with a bird curtain and weighted branch lines1 Tori line2 Night setting with minimum deck lighting Blue-dyed bait Tori line Deep setting line shooter Weighted branch lines Management of offal discharge Hook-shielding devices3   Other Areas"
2018-03_active,active,7," In  other  areas  (between  25°S  and  23°N),  where  necessary,  CCMs  are  encouraged  to have  their  longline vessels employ one or more of the seabird mitigation measures listed in Table 1.  General Principles"
2018-03_active,active,8," For research and reporting purposes, each CCM with longline vessels that fish in the Convention Area south of 25°S or north of 23°N shall submit to the Commission in part 2 of its annual report information describing which of the mitigation measures they require their vessels to use, as well as the technical specifications for each of those mitigation measures. Each such CCM shall also include in its annual reports for subsequent years any changes it has made to its required mitigation measures or technical specifications for those measures."
2018-03_active,active,9," CCMs are encouraged to undertake research to further develop and refine measures to mitigate seabird bycatch including mitigation measures for use during the setting and hauling process and should submit to the Secretariat for the use by the SC and the TCC any information derived from such efforts. Research should be undertaken in the fisheries and areas to which the measure will be used.                                                             1 If using side setting with a bird curtain and weighted branch lines from Column A, this will be counted as two mitigation measures. 2 If a tori line is selected from both Column A and Column B, this equates to simultaneously using two (i.e. paired) tori lines. 3 Hook-shielding devices can be used as a stand-alone measure. 4"
2018-03_active,active,10," The SC and TCC will annually review any new information on new or existing mitigation measures or on seabird interactions from observer or other monitoring programmes. Where necessary, an updated suite of mitigation measures, specifications for mitigation measures, or recommendations for areas of application will then be provided to the Commission for its consideration and review as appropriate."
2018-03_active,active,11, CCMs are encouraged to adopt measures aimed at ensuring that seabirds captured alive during longlining are released alive and in as good condition as possible and that wherever possible hooks are removed without jeopardizing the life of the seabird concerned. Research into the survival of released seabirds is encouraged.
2018-03_active,active,12, The intersessional working group for the regional observer programme (IWG-ROP) will take into account the need to obtain detailed information on seabird interactions to allow analysis of the effects of fisheries on seabirds and evaluation of the effectiveness of bycatch mitigation measures.
2018-03_active,active,13," CCMs shall annually provide to the Commission, in Part 1 of their annual reports, all available information on interactions with seabirds reported or collected by observers to enable the estimation of seabird mortality in all fisheries to which the Convention applies. ( see Annex 2 for Part 1 reporting template guideline).  These reports shall include information on: a) the proportion of observed effort with specific mitigation measures used; a n d   b) observed and reported species specific seabird bycatch rates and numbers o r  statistically rigorous estimates of species-specific seabird interaction rates (for longline, interactions per 1,000 hooks) and total numbers."
2018-03_active,active,14," This Conservation and Management measure replaces CMM 2017-06, which is hereby repealed.   "
