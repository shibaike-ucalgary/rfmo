If the FAD is covered with mesh net, it must have a stretched mesh size less than 7 cm (2.5 inches) and the mesh net must be well wrapped around the whole raft so that there is no netting hanging below the FAD when it is deployed. • The design of the underwater or hanging part (tail) of the FAD should avoid the use of mesh net. If mesh net is used, it must have a stretched mesh size of less than 7 cm (2.5 inches) or tied tightly in bundles or “sausages” with enough weight at the end to keep the netting taut down in the water column.
