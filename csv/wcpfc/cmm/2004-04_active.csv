2004-04_active,active,3,The Technical and Compliance Committee shall provide advice in advance of the second annual session of the Commission on the issues that may require consideration for the effective  implementation of possible conservation and management measures including time/area closures or alternative measures to control sets on floating objects. ADOPTION OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES AT WCPFC 2
2004-04_active,active,4,"In responding to the advice of the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee and any information provided by members at least thirty (30) days in advance of the second annual session, the Commission shall adopt in accordance with article 5 of the Convention conservation and management measures necessary to address sustainability concerns. Such measures may include, inter alia, (a) Catch and/or effort limits; (b) Capacity limits for large-scale tuna fishing vessels; (c) Measures to address impacts of large-scale tuna fishing vessels so as to ensure compatibility between measures applied outside areas of national jurisdiction and measures being applied by coastal states to manage fishing by such vessels within their zones; (d) Time and area closures; and (e) Mitigation measures to address the mortality of non-target species e.g. seabirds, turtles and sharks."
2004-04_active,active,5,In accordance with article 6 of the Convention the precautionary approach will be applied and the absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures. MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE
2004-04_active,active,6,The Technical and Compliance Committee shall consider the regional observer programme as well as the VMS programme as a matter of priority at its 2005 meeting.  CARRY OVER PROVISIONS OF PREVIOUS RESOLUTIONS
