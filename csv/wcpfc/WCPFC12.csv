WCPFC12,7,"After a Balinese welcome dance and warm appreciation to the government of Indonesia for graciously hosting the Commission meeting, the Commission Chair, Ms Rhea Moss-Christian, made some opening remarks. The Chair commented that global security challenges may make it hard to focus on fish, but food and economic security are also important. The Commission has an opportunity and obligation to ensure tuna supplies continue into the future. The Chair noted that at the end of the WCPFC11 meeting in Apia, Samoa the need to find better ways to conserve fish stocks was clear. The Chair noted the commitments members had made to cooperate in moving the Commission forward, and to turn discussion into action, and the Chair is committed to work alongside members and the Executive Director to facilitate this. The Chair thanked the Secretariat for its preparations for the Commission meetings this year, and the work of the Scientific Services Provider, SPC. The meeting would give maximum opportunity to focus on the conservation and management of four key tuna stocks, continue work on the Commission harvest strategy and adopt a work plan, and address the safety of observers – an issue for which there was much goodwill to attend to – and the special requirements of SIDS. The Chair noted that members depend on each other to realise their conservation goals and the status quo was not a long term option. The Chair commented that no territory wants to be the first to move lest it be a sign of weakness but, on the contrary, it was a sign of strength. The Chair’s opening statement is at Attachment B."
WCPFC12,8,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Mr Feleti Teo, OBE, made some opening remarks. The Executive Director noted that this was his first Commission meeting as Executive Director and reiterated his gratitude to Commission members for entrusting him with the responsibility to lead the organisation for the next four years. The Executive Director commented that the meeting brought the opportunity for change and the burden of responsibility and noted the late Nelson Mandela quote that negotiations and discussions are the greatest weapon for peace and development, a principle that is also applicable to managing the treasured fisheries resource of the WCPO. The Executive Director noted three priorities at the Secretariat level including: a) more regular dialogue as a foundation for driving change, b) an updated and reformed strategic planning processes and 3) a more strategic approach to communications to support efforts to connect more effectively with stakeholders guided by a two year communications plan now in place. The Executive Director offered some perspectives including that the scientists had been consistent and clear in observing that some WCPO stocks are subject to overfishing and are in an overfished state, and immediate and urgent actions required. In light of the scientific advice, the Executive Director commented that doing nothing was not an option; a view he observed also shared by the Commission Chair. He added that it is the collective responsibility of all members and stakeholders to rebuild overfished stocks. The Executive Director called for change agents and acknowledged delegations at WCPFC12 with the necessary networks and skills to drive that change and they needed to step up, particularly on the issue of the status of the bigeye tuna. The Executive Director thanked Indonesia for its generous hospitality and excellent meeting arrangements and to the Indonesian Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for her attendance and looked forward to her wise counsel and guidance in her keynote address. The Executive Director’s opening statement is at Attachment C."
WCPFC12,9,"After acknowledging dignitaries and guests, the Republic of Indonesia’s Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Ms Susi Pudjiastuti, made some strong opening remarks, emphasising the economics of the fishery, capacity, regulations to combat IUU fishing and the human side of effective fisheries management and healthy fisheries. Minister Pudjiastuti’s full remarks are at Attachment D."
WCPFC12,10,The meeting opened at 10:00am on Thursday 3 December 2015.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)6  1.2 Adoption of agenda
WCPFC12,11,"The Chair noted two changes had been decided at the heads of delegation meeting on 2 December 2015, immediately prior to WCPFC12: a) Agenda item 8 had been moved forward in the schedule to be discussed directly after agenda item 4, as it relates to criterion in CMM 2013-06 to be used when looking at new proposals, and b) Agenda item 18 (Other matters) would contain an update on the WCPFC VMS.  These changes were noted to have been included in WCPFC12-2015-02_rev2."
WCPFC12,12,"A brief discussion took place about the submission timing of proposals, with one CCM reminding the Commission that at WCPFC2 CCMs had agreed that proposals for new measure should be tabled 30 days before the meeting. It was noted that several proposals at WCPFC12 had not followed that process."
WCPFC12,13,"The Chair noted that in practice, on occasion, the Commission has considered proposals submitted within 30 days; it has depended on the nature of the proposal. It was up to the Commission to decide whether it wanted to strictly adhere to that WCPFC2 agreement, or admit the proposal then submit it to the process where its success was determined by the Commission after being guided by the proponents and worked on at the meeting."
WCPFC12,14,"EU noted it would be in favour of stricter rules as doing so would make examination of proposals and consultation with stakeholders easier, and in other RFMOs proposals are not taken into consideration if they are submitted after the due date."
WCPFC12,15,"The Chair suggested that the Commission allow proposals to be introduced at the relevant time in the agenda for CCMs to address as they wish, through small working groups or drafting groups. There was no objection to this."
WCPFC12,16,"The agenda was adopted with amendments (Attachment E). 1.3 Meeting arrangements 1.3.1 Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMS, others)"
WCPFC12,17,The following small working groups (SWGs) were established to deal with issues in the margins of the meeting before bringing them back to plenary for decision: a) tropical tuna measure CMM 2014-01; b) south Pacific albacore CMM 2010-05; and c) determining the participatory rights for CNMs.
WCPFC12,18,Chinese Taipei offered to lead the CNM SWG. Following further discussions Korea accepted a nomination to lead the CNM SWG. Australia volunteered to lead the South Pacific albacore SWG and the Chair volunteered to lead the SWG looking at the tropical tuna measure (CMM 2014-01).
WCPFC12,19,"In addition, a drafting group was established to consider amendments to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme measure, led by TCC Vice-Chair, Australia offered to lead a small group to consider the TCC work plan, EU led a group discussing sharks and Australia led a group discussing the Workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06."
WCPFC12,20,The Secretariat was asked to prepare a list of working groups and the relevant contacts.  This was subsequently circulated to the meeting as WCPFC12-2015-09B. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)7
WCPFC12,21,"The Executive Director advised the Commission about meeting arrangements including facilities, catering, breakout rooms, document management, side-events, functions and the Sunday free-day tour hosted by the Indonesia government. The record of the meeting would be prepared by the rapporteur, Dr Jane Broweleit. The Executive Director identified the senior Secretariat staff in attendance at WCPFC12 including the Compliance Manager, Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, the Finance and Administration Manager, Aaron Nighswander, and the Science Manager, Dr SungKwon Soh. The new legal consultant, Dr Penny Ridings, was welcomed, as was Victoria Jollands, an intern providing assistance to the Chair."
WCPFC12,22,"RMI noted that a SPREP-RMI jointly-hosted side event on marine pollution from vessels would be held in the margins of WCPFC12, a long overdue issue which RMI intended to take further next year."
WCPFC12,23,"During their first statements across the floor and during their country statements (Agenda item 3) many CCMs thanked the meeting host government Indonesia for its hospitality, warm welcome, meeting arrangements and enjoyable opening ceremony.  AGENDA ITEM 2 – REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC12,24,"As required by Rule 13 of the Rules of the Procedures of the Commission, the Executive Director presented his Annual Report for 2015 (WCPFC12-2015-06). The Executive Director acknowledged the new leadership of the Commission with the new Chair and himself assuming office in March, 2015. With the Chair residing in Pohnpei, the Executive Director had ready and regular access to her counsel and guidance. The Chair’s support for reforms initiated in Secretariat had been gratefully received. The Secretariat noted three key priorities. The first is deeper member engagement through more consistent dialogue, noting that annual meetings were only part of the picture. The outreach program in 2015 included attendance at NC in September to meet with the Asian fishing states and had very productive discussions. Consultations with other members including observers were held at the margins of the SC11 and TCC12 with some consultations continued right up to the eve of the WCPFC12. Continued and regular engagement with all stakeholders will be a key feature of the way the Secretariat will operate in the future. The second priority is effective strategic and business planning, noting that planning activities will be more business-like in approach from now on. The Executive Director noted that the Commission’s current three-year plan and annual work program are not aligned, and there is no planning document that sets out the long term strategic vision for the Commission which may be used to leverage financial and non-financial support for the Commission from members, non-members and international funding mechanisms. A review of the planning framework will allow the Commission to develop a more cohesive planning framework. Thirdly, is enhanced communications with and between the Secretariat and stakeholders, noting a Communication Plan was launched in August and would be delivered over two years. The Executive Director observed that the media will cover the Commission’s activities whether the Commission engages with the media or not, and on this basis, under the plan there would be increased controlled engagement with the media. The Secretariat logo and website will also be updated."
WCPFC12,25,"The Executive Director noted the key work streams for the Commission which included the successful convening of the regular session of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies and the intersessional working groups and Harvest Strategy Workshop. The reports of the subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups and workshop will be presented to WCPFC12. The Executive Director highlighted that 2015 had the most intensive intersessional work program since the Commission’s establishment. The Secretariat was also involved in project management activities as they progressed work on the ABNJ (Common Oceans) Tuna Project - the Sharks and Bycatch, and the WPEA Project which focuses on capacity building in data collection in Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. Implementing the Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) generated a sizeable volume of work, and it was pleasing to report that the draft CMR was completed on time and provided a sound basis for the TCC WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)8  to undertake its review. The Executive Director noted that further development of the IMS system and associated IT infrastructure are work in progress. As part of the communications plan, the second e-newsletter was distributed just prior to WCPFC12. The Executive Director noted that the 2014 financial statements were completed, with the Commission in a stronger financial position but a more long term sustainable funding model is needed. The Executive Director noted that the secretariat also manages the Japan Trust Fund and discussion were advanced with Chinese Taipei in efforts to establish a similar fund. The Executive Director noted the large increase in contributions to the voluntary fund in 2014, and registered the Commission's gratitude and appreciation to those that contributed including Australia, EU, Korea, USA, ISSF and FAO. In respect of the Special Requirements Fund, the Executive Director reported that it is now depleted and unable to support any request. The Executive Director thanked the Commission’s various service providers contracted to perform some of the Commission’s principal functions, especially the scientific services provider, SPC-OFP, and the VMS service provider, FFA. Close links with tuna RFMOs especially IATTC were acknowledged. Broad priorities for the Commission Secretariat for the future include deepening engagement with members and stakeholders, achieving tighter conservation and management for tropical tuna, developing the new strategic plan, continued focus on the CMS and IMS, VMS reporting standards and the CDS, and further development of the ROP."
WCPFC12,26,The Chair noted with appreciation the new leadership within the Secretariat through the Executive Director and the hard work of the Secretariat staff to keep members informed about and engaged in the work of the Commission.
WCPFC12,27,Many CCMs thanked the Executive Director for his comprehensive report and the work carried out by the Secretariat in 2015.
WCPFC12,28,"FFA members acknowledged that the Secretariat staff had carried the Secretariat for six months without an Executive Director last year, keeping the Secretariat functioning and delivering services. These CCMs supported the Executive Director’s efforts to develop a planning framework and strategic plan which was more streamlined. FFA members extended appreciation to the Executive Director and Chair for their proactive and consultative approach in 2015."
WCPFC12,29,"Korea looked forward to continuing programs that strengthen MCS and the scientific work of the Commission along with the further implementation of E-reporting and E-monitoring. This CCM advised that it was implementing E-reporting on a trial basis, with an E-monitoring trial following next year. Korea intended to engage in this work of the Commission with interested CCMs."
WCPFC12,30,"Some CCMs asked that ISC is included in the ‘service provider’ section of the Executive Director Report next year, as it provides a strong contribution to the work of the Commission through the Northern Committee."
WCPFC12,31,Japan enquired about the status of the arrangements between CCSBT and WCPFC mentioned at para. 47 of the Executive Director report.
WCPFC12,32,"The Executive Director apologised for the inadvertent omission of ISC and their scientific services to the NC and that it will be included in future reports. In response to the second query, the Executive Director explained that he was hoping to have an arrangement with CCSBT by the time of the meeting but this was not the case as CCSBT membership is yet to endorse the arrangement formally."
WCPFC12,33,"On behalf of the Pacific territories, France thanked the Secretariat and the Executive Director for their continued collaboration with IATTC. This CCM took the view that collaboration was particularly important and hoped it would continue in coming years. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)9"
WCPFC12,34,China noted that it continues to make a voluntary contribution.
WCPFC12,35,"PNG expressed appreciation for the proposed strategic and corporate plans, noting the terms of reference contained in Annex 1 of the working paper. PNG raised two points in this report: that the IMS system would be developed to improve and make more efficient the work of CCMs in carrying out their responsibility, and streamlining the work of the Secretariat. PNG requested more information on whether the Secretariat was going to increase its staffing to deal with the IMS and sought clarity on how the Commission plans to fund the review of strategic plan and corporate plan."
WCPFC12,36,"The Executive Director noted that the Secretariat continues to improve and upgrade the IMS as the platform from which the Commission undertakes its work. The Secretariat had completed a job sizing evaluation, as reported to the FAC. If the proposal to develop the new strategic plan and the associated corporate plans are endorsed under agenda item 17, those plans will have implications for staffing requirements. In terms of IT staffing, the Executive Director noted that a network administrator position currently exist and yet to be filled and the Secretariat is considering doing so soon. The Secretariat has not identified the source of the funding for developing the new planning document but looks to the membership to provide the funding if it is accepted as an essential work, however, there are discussions ongoing with some of the observers interested in supporting this work."
WCPFC12,37,"The Tuvaluan Minister for Natural Resources, the Hon. Elisala Pita, acknowledged the Executive Director’s report. The Minister noted that there had been a lot of talk but few results in the last few meetings and noted that last year’s meeting in Samoa had an element of disappointment for FFA members. The Minister was pleased to see the agenda for WCPFC12 had been shaped in an attempt to rectify those issues and for every member to work together to achieve the membership’s aim. The Minister noted that for the first time the Commission was led by a Chair and Executive Director from FFA countries. FFA members looked forward to this meeting to come together with other members to resolve issues which have been on the table for a long time."
WCPFC12,38,The Commission noted the 2015 Annual Report of the Executive Director  (WCPFC12-2015-06). AGENDA ITEM 3 – STATEMENTS FROM MEMBERS  AND PARTICIPATING TERRITORIES
WCPFC12,39,"Korea noted the full agenda for WCPFC12, especially for tropical tuna species, and hoped Commission members can come up with practical and effective solutions and have constructive discussions Korea looked forward to participating in these discussions to provide fruitful outcomes."
WCPFC12,40,"On behalf of Tuvalu, the Minister for Natural Resources, Hon. Elisala Pita, drew the Commission’s attention for the third year in a row to the critical importance of the decisions made at WCPFC12 to a small fishery-dependent state like Tuvalu. The Minister noted that last year in Apia it was agreed, through CMM 2014-01, to maintain the fourth month of FAD closure as a way to conserve bigeye. Tuvalu, with other PNA countries, rigorously implemented this but other WCPFC coastal states failed to impose the FAD closure in their waters, DWFN longliners did not deliver the bigeye catch reductions they committed to, and bigeye catches in the high seas have continued to increase. This year, PNA is proposing a revision to CMM 2014-01, prohibiting transhipment of frozen bigeye at sea, limit purse-seining in the high seas, and tighten up the FAD closures by prohibiting pre-dawn sets by purse-seiners. The Minister hoped and expected that members of the Commission will accept the refinements but if they do not Tuvalu will reconsider its position on the FAD closures. The Minister mentioned Tuvalu’s struggle to expand its fleet from one to two vessels and noted that Tuvalu would not agree to WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)10  capacity management measures until convinced that they are consistent with SIDS rights to develop their fisheries for their own benefit. The Minister wished the Commission well in its deliberations"
WCPFC12,41,"Philippines expressed its deepest appreciation to the Government of Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12 and the people of Bali. The Philippines noted its committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks consistent with its rights and obligations under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the WCPFC Convention. Philippines noted that its commitment is demonstrated in the progressive implementation of the Convention and CMMs, and cooperation with other CCMs."
WCPFC12,42,"On behalf of New Zealand, Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development, Shane Jones, thanked Indonesia and the Secretariat as hosts and organisers and noted that New Zealand attaches a high priority to the development of the region’s fisheries and recognises the importance of working together through this Commission. New Zealand strongly supported the strategies in the Regional Roadmap for Sustainable Pacific Fisheries that Leaders agreed to at the Pacific Island Forum, as Pacific Leaders expressed their objective of continuing to improve the sustainable management of fisheries. New Zealand noted the particular importance of committing to a TRP for the management of South Pacific albacore to help restore the economic viability of the southern longline fishery. New Zealand also noted the importance of improving the reporting on, and compliance with, conservation and management measures established by this Commission. Signs of pressure on some stocks was noted, with a need to ensure that harvesting remains sustainable, the burden of conservation is fair and that returns are delivered to countries that depend most upon this resource. The challenge for WCPFC12 will be to work through hard negotiations and compromise to make progress. It was noted that the highly charged tone of the Indonesian Minister’s speech set the scene for what those in a position of stewardship in the Pacific want to sustain, spread and entrench."
WCPFC12,43,"As the host country, Indonesia welcomed WCPFC12 to Bali, and noted that it has been 12 years since the Commission was established. Scientific advice now indicates that some species are showing signs of overfishing. This means the Commission needs to increase its effort to meet the common goals of all parties. Indonesia noted that developing harvest strategies and harvest control rules in accordance with CMM 2014-06 will increase WCPFC’s reputation as an RFMO with effective and efficient conservation and management mechanisms. Indonesia noted that it is developing a harvest strategy and/or harvest control rule for yellowfin and skipjack tunas within Indonesia’s archipelagic waters (Indonesia Fisheries Management Areas 713, 714 and 715) to ensure that tuna resources in Indonesian waters are managed with compatible measures adopted by RFMOs. Indonesia noted that it has received technical support from IOTC, CSIRO-Australia and the WCPFC WPEA project, as well as from NGOs concerned with tuna fisheries management. Indonesia commented that the Commission will find the way to show its commitment to ensuring the sustainable management of tuna resources as required in Article 2 of the Convention."
WCPFC12,44,"The CNMI expressed its gratitude to Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12 and advised WCPFC12 of the fishing arrangements that have been established between the U.S. Participating Territories, including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Hawaii longline vessels, which allows Hawaiian vessels to fish, subject to strict limits set for the US Territories. These arrangements offer a critical source of funds that the Territories otherwise would not have, to pursue their fishery development aspirations. The CNMI is implementing fisheries infrastructure development including vessel docks and shore-side facilities, local fish market construction, fisher training including pelagic and bottom fishing techniques, and seafood handling training as a result of this opportunity. The CNMI stated that these arrangements are fully consistent with Commission decisions and noted that the CNMI does not have industrial fisheries at present; the benefits support CNMI’s small fishing communities. CNMI will submit a letter for circulation to the Commission providing further information on this issue. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)11"
WCPFC12,45,"American Samoa thanked the Government of Indonesia for being a generous and gracious host and noted that American Samoa is a US territory and also a developing participating territory with its own fisheries development aspirations and vulnerabilities. Its isolation and distance add high transport costs and make our products less competitive. As an economy that is highly dependent on tuna fisheries, American Samoa noted the need to keep its tuna fisheries viable, and supported the mechanism established under US law that allows the US participating territories to transfer a portion of its annual longline bigeye tuna catch limit to qualifying US vessels, process that takes into account Commission decisions, stock status and US territory fisheries development needs. American Samoa noted that its tuna fisheries and economy are threatened by labour issues, high safety standards, market forces and the loss of their historical fishing grounds, despite having a safe, deep harbor, with excellent facilities in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. Effort limits and adverse economic conditions have slowed down the delivery of fish to American Samoa’s canneries and have affected the economy."
WCPFC12,46,"USA recalled the objectives of the Convention, and the task to support small island states and participating territories to develop and maintain their fisheries in a fair and equitable manner and in a way that supports the primary objective of the Convention, acting on the best available science based on timely access to high-quality, relevant data. The Commission has more work to do in terms of collecting information, such as through observers, and getting it to the scientific service providers while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the information. USA advised that it had a number of objectives for the meeting which are broadly described as improving the management of specific stocks within the WCPO and improving the way in which the Commission does its business. USA noted that its implementation of obligations under the tropical tuna measure, combined with actions by coastal states in the region, has imposed a high price on at least one US territory. This CCM is assessing the impacts of these decisions on communities which are dependent on access to these resources and will be asking for consideration of spatial approaches to longline fishery management and appropriate treatment of the high seas for purse seine fishery management. USA called on CCMs member to enact laws and regulations, rigorously monitor vessels, close fisheries when limits are reached, and take enforcement action against vessels that violate the rules. This CCM also called for a permanent CMS."
WCPFC12,47,PNG offered its sincere appreciation to Indonesia and welcomed the speech by the Indonesian Minister. PNG paid tribute to Charles Karnella for his leadership over the previous 4 years and congratulated the incoming Chair and new Executive Director. PNG has adopted enabling policies to provide a conducive environment for proactive fisheries management. The challenge for PNG is to transform this into practical human development outcomes. This CCM noted that the PNA longline vessel day scheme should bring in much-needed reforms and called on the Commission to adopt comparable measures and fully support the PIF’s fisheries roadmap. PNG noted that the special circumstances and vulnerabilities of SIDS was a fundamental consideration for this Commission as laid out in Article 30. PNG advised that it had signed a joint communique on IUU and transnational crime with Indonesia for actions in their respective national jurisdictions.
WCPFC12,48,"Australia recognised the importance of fisheries to the region, as an integral part of the cultural, social and economic identity of many members of this Commission and noted that fisheries are a critical contributor to Pacific Island revenues and underpin their capacity to build resilience and address development needs. The Commission’s challenge is to work together proactively to implement effective management arrangements for the key stocks. Australia has focussed over the last two years on promoting the development of harvest strategies for management of the Commission’s tuna fisheries and will work with members this year to agree on a workplan for this critical agenda. Australia supported the development of a new strategic plan for the Commission, recognising the importance of having a clear vision and plan to achieve it. Australia noted that WCPFC12 will be asked to consider a number of proposals that will directly contribute towards the development of harvest strategies, and hoped to see significant progress on these proposals. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)12"
WCPFC12,49,"Guam supported the statements provided by CNMI and American Samoa regarding its domestic arrangements with US vessels, and noted that this mechanism is important for the development of Guam’s local domestic fisheries. Guam advised that the Governor of Guam is making plans for the development of a locally-based longline fleet to supply its domestic market and local tourism-based economy. Guam announced its hosting of the SPC Festival of the Pacific Arts in May 2016, involving the participation of 27 Pacific island nations with 3,000 delegates along with thousands of visitors to follow FestPAC’s two week Olympic of Cultures. Guam wished delegations a productive meeting."
WCPFC12,50,"RMI noted that a number of key issues demand action by the Commission: developing mechanisms to ensure the health, well-being and safety of fisheries observers as they carry out their duties, a push for a more coordinated and practical approach by the Commission to transshipment and reconsideration of the application of the ‘impracticability’ provisions in the measure, the improved monitoring of fishing activities in high seas pocket 1 as concerns were raised at TCC about alleged IUU fishing activities inside the pocket, implementation of the criteria in CMM 2013-06 to help address the disproportionate burden, and the special requirements of SIDS and the checklist adopted through CMM 2013-07 being incorporated into CCMs’ business practices and a commencement of discussions and the formulation of budgets to support implementation of the CMM."
WCPFC12,51,Chinese Taipei noted that WCPFC has had significant achievements in enhancing conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks in western and central Pacific Ocean. Recently some proposals and discussions have focused on economic interests and political consideration rather than constructive discussions on conservation and management measures. Chinese Taipei expressed its desire and willingness to make further efforts to facilitate the functioning of the Commission in ensuring long-term conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in this area.
WCPFC12,52,"FSM noted that its delegation included members of its national legislative body who have taken the time to observe for themselves the work of the Commission but also to learn more about what the Commission is doing to manage and conserve the fishery resources with the Commission Convention Area. As other Pacific Island countries do, FSM attaches great importance to their effective management because tuna offers the greatest opportunity for economic self-sufficiency and food security into the future. In addition, revenue from licensing represents a significant part of our local revenue and with declining revenues from traditional partners and the challenges of being a small economy, fisheries support our government’s basic services including health, education and social development programs. FSM seeks to develop them to create jobs and new economic opportunities and noted that it was ready to work with other members of the Commission towards that outcome. FSM stressed the importance of the Commission’s work and, as the host to the WCPFC Secretariat, reiterated its commitment to making the Secretariat function in an environment that is conducive to its effectiveness and efficiency in service to its members. AGENDA ITEM 4 – MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 4.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC12,53,"New Zealand, as Depositary of the WCPF Convention, advised WCPFC12 that since its last report to the Eleventh Regular Session of the Commission in December 2015 in Apia, Samoa, New Zealand has not received notification of any instruments of ratification or accession to the Convention (WCPFC12-2015-05)."
WCPFC12,54,The Commission noted the Report on the Status of the Convention (WCPFC12-2015-05). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)13  4.2 Update on Observer status
WCPFC12,55,"The Executive Director advised the Commission of applications for observer status and observers invited out of session to participate at WCPFC12. WCPFC12-2015-07 provided the list of observers to date, categorised as either IGO or NGO observers. There are 57 observers – 16 IGOs and 41 NGOs – and since WCPFC11 six new observers were admitted as per the Rules of Procedure."
WCPFC12,56,"FFA members noted the number of organisations now official observers to the Commission. These CCMs supported transparency and openness of Commission meetings, and appreciated the contributions of observers. However, they were concerned about some SIDS members being strained from year to year in meeting their annual assessed contributions and the escalating costs of the meetings due to the high numbers of attendees. These CCMs proposed that the Commission undertake some analysis and review of the current list of observers considering the following elements: a) the number of observers that had attended meetings; b) whether it was appropriate to limit numbers on observers’ delegations; c) whether it was appropriate for observers to pay an annual contribution towards the meeting costs; and d) how to accommodate treating separately observers which support the SIDS’ effective participation in the Commission – the SPC, the FFA Secretariat and the PNA Office – as these bodies are also separately recognised under the CMS measure."
WCPFC12,57,Executive Director noted that the matter of a fee was raised during FAC discussions early in the meeting. The FAC agreed to task the Secretariat to look into the issue of charging a fee for observers and report back to FAC next year. It was noted that if a further broader review was requested the Secretariat could accommodate that review.
WCPFC12,58,"The EU considered that a review could be a way forward, noting the number of observers participating. However, the analysis by the Secretariat should not be limited to a contribution to the cost of meetings by observers, but should also look at other issues and the way observers contribute to the work of the Commission, including issues relating to transparency and access to documents. This CCM was reluctant to see a cap placed on the number of observers and suggested the issues could be discussed together at TCC in advance of WCPFC13, not just FAC."
WCPFC12,59,"The American Fishermen’s Research Foundation suggested that, when thinking about setting a fee for observers, the size of the organisation, the number of delegates that attend meetings, and which observers are true stakeholders, such as harvest groups, should be considered. This observer organisation noted that it funds itself to go to the three WCPFC-related meetings each year."
WCPFC12,60,"The Chair noted the Commission’s general agreement to undertake a review of observer participation at the Commission, covering the elements which had been raised by FFA, EU and the observer group."
WCPFC12,61,"The Commission noted the updated list of observers provided in WCPFC12-2015-07 and tasked the Secretariat to undertake a review of observer participation at the Commission, covering the following possible elements:  • the number of observers which have attended meetings; • whether it is appropriate to limit numbers on observers’ delegations; • whether it is appropriate for observers to pay an annual contribution towards the meeting costs; • how to accommodate treating separately observers which support the SIDS’ effective participation in the Commission (specifically SPC, FFA, PNAO); • whether and/or how to accommodate treating separately observers that are direct stakeholders, such as harvest groups; • Transparency; WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)14  • access to documents;  and to report back to WCPFC13. 4.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member status"
WCPFC12,62,"The TCC Vice-Chair, J. Anderson (New Zealand) presented the TCC11 recommendations (TCC11 Summary Report para 117) in respect of the seven applicants, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam for WCPFC12 consideration (WCPFC12-2015-08). In accordance with CMM 2009-11 on CNMs, the Commission considered the seven applications which had been submitted for CNM status for 2016."
WCPFC12,63,"The Chair asked for general comments, advising that the Commission would then take each applicant in turn to consider their CNM status."
WCPFC12,64,"FFA members maintained that CNMs are to pay a contribution to the Commission as required under the measure and agreed at WCPFC11 – 50% of the amount that would be payable if the CNM was a member (agreed at WCPFC7), premised on the principle that all participants must share the costs of conservation and management of these stocks. FFA members thank those CNMs that have paid their contributions, and noted that Mexico’s contribution remained outstanding. FFA members recalled that this was a subject of extensive discussion at the last Commission meeting and in granting CNM status to Mexico the Commission was assured that they would investigate the possibility of a voluntary payment. These CCMs called on Mexico to update the Commission on these discussions and reiterated that FFA members do not agree to CNM status for any applicant with an outstanding financial contribution or who is unable to commit to making the contribution for next year."
WCPFC12,65,"Japan noted that overcapacity in the purse-seine sector is a major problem of the Commission and requested that the CNMs work together to solve this problem. Japan requested an update from Vietnam on the construction of vessels which could participate in fishing in the WCPFC area, and also requested Vietnam  continue to provide such information to prevent further expansion of the purse-seine fleet in the WCPO."
WCPFC12,66,"Vietnam stated that in 2015 one large-scale tuna fishing vessel was built in Vietnam. It was 100% owned by a French company. It was delivered in June 2015 and flagged to the Seychelles and operates in the Indian Ocean. At present, no construction of large-scale tuna fishing vessels is taking place in Vietnam and there are also no contracts for future construction of such vessels. There is no further construction in Vietnam taking place and no contracts for future construction. Vietnam emphasised that it wanted to fully cooperate with the Commission. However it noted that this discussion should not be part of the procedure of granting CNM status."
WCPFC12,67,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Ecuador as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,68,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Ecuador.
WCPFC12,69,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting El Salvador as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,70,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for El Salvador.
WCPFC12,71,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Mexico as a member for 2016. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)15
WCPFC12,72,"The Secretariat was asked for an update on the status of Mexico’s contribution. It was confirmed that as of 13 November, Mexico had not provided a financial contribution (WCPFC12-2015-08)."
WCPFC12,73,Palau noted that as a SIDS it has problems making its contribution but has managed to do so. This CCM objected to Mexico’s application.
WCPFC12,74,"The USA expressed sympathy for Palau’s argument, but noted that it did not interpret the CMM in the same way, and in USA’s view the lack of a contribution did not provide a bar to participation. Rather, it was in the interest of the Commission to have Mexico participate, especially in NC on Pacific bluefin tuna, which was a stock in serious trouble and required work among all the countries involved whether on the eastern or western side of the Pacific. USA noted that Mexico had expressed a willingness to engage in the Commission and is essential to our solving the bluefin issue, and it would be a mistake to preclude them. USA further noted that in the past Mexico has explained the legal prohibitions it has, and that those prohibitions resolve if it could become a member of the Commission. This CCM suggested that a better course of action would be to agree to invite Mexico to become a member."
WCPFC12,75,"Canada, China, EU, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei supported USA’s views. While expressing sympathy with the SIDS position, China suggested a voluntary contribution could be made through industry or an association. Japan noted that Mexico is the second largest Pacific bluefin tuna harvester and cooperation with Mexico is essential for management of this stock."
WCPFC12,76,"Nauru supported Palau’s intervention, noting that Mexico was not even in attendance."
WCPFC12,77,"Tokelau reiterated the FFA position from last year’s Commission meeting, whereby they would not agree to CNM status for any member that has an outstanding financial position and suggested that Mexico works on its legal constraints and applies for CNM status once that is addressed."
WCPFC12,78,The Chair noted that there is not a Commission decision to accept Mexico as a CNM as the application has not been accepted by consensus and this would be reflected in the report.
WCPFC12,79,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Panama as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,80,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Panama.
WCPFC12,81,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Thailand as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,82,"Japan commented that Thailand was accepted into the Commission because of its unique situation having large amounts of cannery data, as most of Thailand’s catch for canning comes from the WCPFC region, and requested Thailand to confirm whether information on its cannery data were provided to the WCPFC or not."
WCPFC12,83,Thailand noted that it requests data from the canning companies and submits it to the WCPFC each year.
WCPFC12,84,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Thailand.
WCPFC12,85,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Vietnam as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,86,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Vietnam.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)16
WCPFC12,87,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Liberia as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,88,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Liberia.
WCPFC12,89,"On 5 December Korea reported that the CNM SWG had met, with substantial discussion taking place on the six applications which had been accepted as CNMs for 2016. There were issues remaining and the group was waiting to hear from Mexico. Panama had made a request to include the term ‘supporting vessel’ and the SWG was exploring the implications of including that term. This SWG required another meeting to continue these discussions. The Executive Director noted that the Secretariat had a short time ago received a letter from Mexico with a commitment to pay the CNM membership fee. This letter was posted for all CCMs to read (WCPFC12-2015-OP19)."
WCPFC12,90,PNG sought clarification about whether the commitment is to provide the financial contribution which had been due this year or if it was for next year. This CCM noted that the Commission had already decided that Mexico’s application would not be accepted for 2016. PNG asked the Secretariat to seek clarification which payments were being committed to.
WCPFC12,91,On 7 December the Chair reminded CCMs that there had been questions about Mexico’s financial commitment for 2015. It was noted that a delegate from Mexico had now arrived at the meeting and he could address the application and the question of financial commitment.
WCPFC12,92,"Mexico noted that delegations will have seen the letter from the Mexico government (WCPFC12-2015-OP19), demonstrating Mexico’s interest to continue participating in WCPFC as a CNM. Mexico noted that it had participated in several meetings and fully cooperated with the NC and ISC. It provided information punctually and the information it provides is used by the Commission to make management decisions. Mexico noted that the main reason for Mexico's participation was not a need to fish in WCPFC waters, as Mexico had abundant yellowfin in its own EEZ. Rather, Mexico shared in the responsibility of managing the marine resources of the Pacific, and to participate in the technical and scientific committees of the two organisations. Mexico further noted that it only catches fish in the area shared with IATTC. Mexico stated that it would like to participate as a full member in the future. Mexico asked for advice from the Secretariat about the amount of contribution it was required to pay, whether it was voluntary and how it was calculated, and commented that it had not received information from the Commission in this regard. Mexico noted its understanding that some delegations had supported Mexico’s position during initial discussions early in the meeting, and hoped to work through the next steps to continue its CNM status."
WCPFC12,93,"The Secretariat advised that at the end of each annual meeting the Executive Director sends a letter to each of CNM applicant advising of the outcome. That letter includes the expected financial contribution, based on the approved budget. This was stated in the letter to Mexico and other CNMs applicants on 19 February 2015. In addition, follow up letters were sent following TCC11 which drew the attention of CNM applicants to any gaps in financial contributions. It was noted that these communications which confirmed the contribution amount were as per the decision made at WCPFC11 to do so. The Commission assesses the financial commitment of CNMs to be 50% of what that member would have paid if it had been a full member. Mexico’s contribution for 2015 was assessed at $27,070 – half of the $54,140 the contribution would have been if Mexico had been full member."
WCPFC12,94,The representative from Mexico noted that with a figure in hand he will report to capital. Mexico stated that the commitment to pay the due is in the form of a promise from the Mexico government to cover the dues as soon as possible. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)17
WCPFC12,95,"In light of the new information from Mexico, a lengthy discussion took place about whether the Commission was prepared to accept Mexico’s CNM request for 2016."
WCPFC12,96,"Several CCMs spoke in favour of Mexico being accepted as a CNM, with Japan outlining its support was based on Mexico being an important participant in the NC regarding Pacific bluefin tuna, a species which migrates to the EPO, and being the second largest harvester of the species. USA and China strongly supported the application, as did France on behalf of the French territories in the Pacific, due to the shared management of stocks and the cooperation between IATTC and WCPFC. EU considered the presence of Mexico and its participation in the NC work to be essential and hoped Mexico would become a full member in the future."
WCPFC12,97,"Nauru asked for clarification around whether, if the Commission accepts the application, Mexico has 90 days to pay and whether, if that payment is not forthcoming, the application is rejected."
WCPFC12,98,"The Chair noted the case of Senegal at WCPFC11, where a conditional acceptance was given, provided the payment was made by a certain date."
WCPFC12,99,Chinese Taipei noted that it could go along with others on imposing a condition and appreciated the commitment from Mexico of this payment. This CCM hoped the payment would be made by January or February.
WCPFC12,100,"Canada supported the inclusion of Mexico as a CNM but expressed doubts about the conditional aspect, noting that Mexico’s internal system for making the payment may need more time and that the WCPFC should go by the commitment when deciding on Mexico’s CNM status."
WCPFC12,101,"Philippines noted that it was satisfied with the commitment, noting that it was made by a representative of the government."
WCPFC12,102,"The Chair noted that there was support for the application but that the issue of payment not having been made was outstanding. The Chair noted the precedent which had been set at WCPFC11 to apply a condition to Senegal and suggested that members accept this as a way of proceeding, and that payment would be due 90 days after 15 January 2016, which is the date members are notified to pay their financial contributions."
WCPFC12,103,There were no objections to this.
WCPFC12,104,Mexico queried the decision to make the application conditional.
WCPFC12,105,"FSM supported Nauru’s comment on conditionality, commenting that last year the Commission had heard the same commitment. The condition would hold Mexico to making the payment within 90 days or it would lose its CNM status."
WCPFC12,106,"Japan noted that if the decision to make the acceptance conditional was based on practice not the measure relating to CNMs, the Commission could consider changing the current practice to be more flexible in order to accommodate Mexico. This CCM commented that WCPFC is the only tuna RFMO which obliges a budgetary contribution from CNMs, and noted that for CNM countries this is a budget issue with not only the fisheries ministries involved but also the finance ministries."
WCPFC12,107,RMI noted that there were reservations to the application and the established rule in WCPFC is that decisions are taken by consensus. Kiribati supported RMI’s comments.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)18
WCPFC12,108,PNG asked Mexico to clarify whether it would allow HSBI by WCPFC authorised inspection vessels.
WCPFC12,109,FSM noted the lengthy discussion both earlier in the meeting and during these current discussions and expressed concern that the Commission would be opening the door for others to take the same approach. This CCM encouraged Mexico to make the payment. FSM noted PNG’s question about HSBI and commented that this issue was raised as it was about Mexico agreeing to apply rules that are applied by other participants. This CCM noted that if Mexico is not accepted as a CNM it can still cooperate with the NC as an observer.
WCPFC12,110,"The Chair noted the lack of consensus on accepting Mexico’s application, whether conditional or not and discussions on the matter ceased."
WCPFC12,111,"Korea asked that the WCPFC legal advisor attend the 7 December CNM SWG meeting and on 8 December, Korea noted that a second draft had been developed and would be posted shortly."
WCPFC12,112,"On 8 December, Korea reported that it had taken on board all comments so far and would meet again during the lunch break. It was noted that the SWG had received confirmation that Mexico had paid its dues on 7 December, and the WCPFC Finance and Administration Manager had confirmed the transaction."
WCPFC12,113,"The Chair noted that the issue which was outstanding for Mexico was its payment, so there were no outstanding matters to address. The Chair suggested that the Commission now accepted the CNM application and the CNM SWG could now consider Mexico’s participatory rights."
WCPFC12,114,There were no objections to this.
WCPFC12,115,The Commission agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Mexico. 4.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs
WCPFC12,116,"In accordance with paras. 12 and 13 of CMM 2009-11, the CNM SWG reviewed the participatory rights of CNMs for the Commission’s adoption. On 8 December 2015, Korea presented the final report of the CNM SWG, WCPFC12-2015-31, outlining the participatory rights for the seven CNM applicants."
WCPFC12,117,"The Commission noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam in the CNM-SWG discussions."
WCPFC12,118,"The SWG agreed to recommend that the CNMs accepted by the WCPFC plenary (Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam) have the same participatory rights in 2016 as they had in 2015."
WCPFC12,119,"The SWG noted the recommendation from TCC11 that WCPFC12 take into consideration the Compliance Status of all CNM applicants in making its decision on the CNM applications and participatory rights, including encouraging them to rectify any gaps or issues in their applications prior to WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,120,"The Commission agreed that: a) In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)19  fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  b) In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  c) CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV). d) CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  e) Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account -compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC. Participatory rights of each CNM in 2016 Ecuador"
WCPFC12,121,The Commission noted Ecuador’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged Ecuador to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,122,"The Commission agreed that Ecuador’s participatory rights for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2014-01 or its replacement measure. El Salvador"
WCPFC12,123,The Commission noted El Salvador’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged El Salvador to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,124,The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2014-01 or its replacement measure. Liberia
WCPFC12,125,The Commission noted that Liberia was not subject to compliance evaluation in CMR covering 2014 activities.
WCPFC12,126,"The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Liberia are limited to reefer vessels to engage in transshipment activities, and bunker and supply vessels to support fishing vessels in the Convention area. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)20  Mexico"
WCPFC12,127,The Commission noted that CMR covering 2014 activities assessed Mexico to be in full compliance with all applicable CMMs.
WCPFC12,128,"The Commission noted that Mexico had participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC 8, 9, 10 and 11 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to continue to participate in the NC. Mexico does not intend to have a vessel presence in 2016. The Commission agreed that any future introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2014-01 or its replacement measure. Panama"
WCPFC12,129,The Commission noted Panama’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged Panama to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,130,"The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. At the request of Panama, and after consulting the Legal Advisor, the SWG noted that Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transshipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs. The Commission noted that this does not result in any additional participatory rights in 2016 to the participatory rights granted to Panama in 2015. Thailand"
WCPFC12,131,The Commission noted Thailand’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged Thailand to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,132,"The Commission noted the need for cooperation between Thailand and the Commission and the commitment from Thailand to provide data from canneries located in Thailand to assist in the work of the Commission, considering that the CNM status was granted to Thailand for 2016 on the understanding that Thailand will cooperate fully with the Commission in the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The Commission noted the provision of data from Thai canneries and encourages Thailand to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. Vietnam"
WCPFC12,133,The Commission noted that in the CMR covering 2014 activities assessed Vietnam to be in full compliance with all applicable CMMs. Vietnam also informed the Commission that it had provided its assessed financial contribution.
WCPFC12,134,"The Commission noted the need for continued cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, as well as on the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data, for which Vietnam would require assistance. The Commission noted its appreciation that the significant improvements in the collection and provision of data from Vietnam fisheries through the GEF WPEA project, administered by the WCPFC and encourages Vietnam WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)21  to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area"
WCPFC12,135,"The Commission agreed that: a. In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area. b. In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area. c. For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area."
WCPFC12,136,The Chair thanked Korea for its leadership of the SWG which had worked through these issues.  AGENDA ITEM 8 – SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES 8.1 Updated checklist evaluation of SIDS special requirements (FFA)
WCPFC12,137,"At WCPFC11, FFA members submitted WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev2 to assist developed CCMs to implement Article 30 of the Convention and CMM 2013-07 by targeting their assistance to specific requirements of SIDS. WCPFC11 agreed to use the checklist in that working paper as a guide when developing proposals. FFA members submitted WCPFC12-2015-DP01 to WCPFC12 as an updated list."
WCPFC12,138,"FFA members acknowledged the proponents of the proposals introduced at agenda item 5 which included an assessment against the questions in CMM 2013-06 para. 3. FFA members commented that ongoing engagement with those questions will improve the Commission’s ability to adopt measures that do not place a disproportionate burden on SIDS, or at least identify mechanisms within each measure to mitigate it. These CCMs emphasised that the questions should be given the intended consideration and provide detailed information, particularly to support conclusions about impacts on SIDS, disproportionate burden and impacts on SIDS’ development or access to resources."
WCPFC12,139,"Australia acknowledged the amendments and encouraged members to give CMM 2013-06 consideration as well as regard to Article 30 of the Convention. This CCM noted that the Commission has had difficult discussions about how to operationalise that article, but noted that a range of options were open to CCMs."
WCPFC12,140,"FFA members acknowledged that they did not expect proponents of measures to have an innate understanding of their issues, needs and vulnerabilities, which may make it difficult to provide WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)22  information and well-supported conclusions, but noted that this does not remove their responsibility to fully address CMM 2013-06. FFA members recommended that proponents consult with SIDS on these questions when preparing proposals and analysing their impacts – consultation which would help progress understanding of disproportionate burden and increase the Commission’s ability to avoid it. It was noted that FFA meets for its annual Management Options Consultation in late October each year which provides an opportunity for their advice to be sought in advance of WCPFC.  8.2 CCM reports on the implementation of Article 30"
WCPFC12,141,CCMs were invited to report on their initiatives to implement Article 30 of the Convention.
WCPFC12,142,"EU noted that its targeted assistance goes to multi-annual activities including training and capacity building. This CCM stressed that discussions about priorities take place directly with SIDS – for example the negotiations for EDF11, including the fisheries strand worth €35 million, were currently taking place in the region to identify priorities. This CCM considered that sometimes it is difficult to make a distinction with what is asked in terms of assistance to SIDS in WCPFC and asked that where needs are identified with development agencies there should be discussions in those fora, explaining that EU submits the FFA checklist to its development agencies so it is taken into consideration for assistance."
WCPFC12,143,"Japan noted that it has been assisting developing states including SIDS for their development of fisheries by constructing infrastructure and capacity building through its official development assistance and Overseas Fisheries Cooperative Foundation (OFCF). This amounted to about USD400 million over the last five years. Japan also has supported SIDS through provisions of fisheries experts from OFCF and JICA and by receiving trainees from SIDS. This year, during the Seventh Pacific Leaders Meeting (PALM7), Japan pledged to provide no less than 55 billion yen in the next 3 years. This CCM noted its support since 2008 for capacity building in respect of statistics, and fisheries management and enforcement through the Japan Trust Fund. Japan also supported SIDS through an FFA Promotional Fund since 2008."
WCPFC12,144,"Chinese Taipei noted that it has fulfilled its commitment to enhancing capacity building in fisheries conservation and management and has implemented Article 30 and CMM 2013-07. Chinese Taipei’s long term fisheries sector assistance to SIDS included observer training and enhancing the MCS capacity of SIDS, technology transfer and support for the domestic fisheries sector. Chinese Taipei has held three observer trainings since 2010 through its Regional Observer Training Project and has assigned scholars and technical trainers to several SIDS for the benefit of local students, fishermen and technical staff for some years. Chinese Taipei noted that for many years it has encouraged investment in SIDS’ fisheries sector and noted its announcement at WCPFC11 that it will contribute a trust fund of USD2 million over 5 years to finance the implementation of CMMs in developing states. This will be established in consultation with the Secretariat."
WCPFC12,145,"China noted the Chinese government’s November 2014 decision to allow most products from SIDS, including fish products, duty free access to the Chinese market. China has also established loans of billions of dollars to encourage economic development in SIDS, including a joint venture with FSM for Kosrae to be a centre for longline vessel repairs in the Pacific. Chinese investment also focused don territories, with billions of dollars to establish a marine park in French Polynesia."
WCPFC12,146,"Korea acknowledged the special requirements of SIDS and noted that it was meeting them in various ways, including working to establish a UN FAO centre of excellence for fisheries-related tertiary education. Students, including those from Pacific island states, would be funded by the Korean government, including financial support while studying.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)23"
WCPFC12,147,"FFA members thanked CCMs for their updates and the assistance outlined in their Annual Reports Part 2, but commented that there was room for improvement, noting that: very few responses clearly articulated the assistance provided; several CCMs repeated their statements against a number of provisions; some did not provide any details, and; two CCMs provided no response at all. FFA members noted that the reports do not provide sufficient advice about assistance to SIDS and made no clear link between to the specific areas highlighted in the FFA list on SIDS priority needs outlined in WCPFC12-2015-DP01, and reiterated that the intention was to ensure the provision of systematic and targeted assistance to SIDS. 8.3 Review of implementation of CMM 2013-07 (Paragraph 20)"
WCPFC12,148,"Pursuant to para. 20 of CMM 2013-07, the Commission discussed progress on the implementation of Article 30 of the Convention and CMM 2013-07."
WCPFC12,149,"RMI gave appreciation for the changes made to the agenda to address concerns around CMM 2013-07, and commented that the CMM 2013-06 was not addressed well here. This CCM noted the link between the two measures as both address SIDS issues, and reminded the Commission of the explicit link to the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement and 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Article 10 of the Convention addresses the adoption of CMMs. This CCM noted that CMMs are binding instruments while resolutions were not. WCPFC10 saw the adoption of two important measures, CMMs 2013-06 and 2013-07, providing that new proposals were required to be considered in accordance with their criteria. RMI asked that the record note that two years later this has not happened, and noted that the Commission is picking and choosing management measures it will implement. This CCM commented that this is not consistent with the Convention and the rules adopted to support the work and looked forward to assessing the proposals against CMM 2013-06."
WCPFC12,150,"The Chair noted that by its very nature this issue will be discussed throughout the meeting agenda. Late in the meeting, the Chair came back to this item."
WCPFC12,151,"RMI noted its disappointment in the lack of progress and implementation of CMM 2013-06 and requested that an assessment be conducted against the measure and that CCMs undertake consultations with SIDS regarding targeted assistance, taking into account the SIDS checklist. RMI called for the development of a way to ensure the sustainability of the Special Requirements Fund, so it was not reliant solely on voluntary contributions, perhaps by way of making it mandatory."
WCPFC12,152,"EU noted that it did its best to assess their few proposals against the criteria in CMM 2013-06 and asked what the process was for consultation with SIDS, practically. This CCM agreed that impacts were not easy to measure. EU asked for some pragmatic solutions regarding the consultations, including nominating a contact point."
WCPFC12,153,"RMI explained that the proposal was about enhancing engagement, and noted that FFA has a process for its lead-up to the annual meeting of WCPFC, including the October FFA Management Options Consultation meeting. CCMs were encouraged to email or visit, and FFA and PNA Commissioners were good contacts."
WCPFC12,154,The Chair noted that CCMs were open to enhancing and continuing those discussions.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)24  AGENDA ITEM 5 – INTRODUCTION OF NEW PROPOSALS
WCPFC12,155,"The Chair noted that the Secretariat had provided a list of proposals for new measures to be introduced (WCPFC12-2015-09).  Those which don’t relate to other agenda items would be introduced briefly under agenda item 5, with limited or no discussion on them and proponents requested to work in the margins with interested delegations. Initial discussions on the FFA proposal for a harvest strategy work plan would take place under the tropical tuna and albacore agenda items with the work plan being treated like a new proposal, and a decision on its adoption would take place under agenda item 15. The WCPFC IUU Vessel List and new proposals would both be introduced early then finalised later in the meeting after further discussions. The Chair urged interested participants to meet with the relevant contact person."
WCPFC12,156,"CCMs tabled new proposals, introducing them and explaining their rationale and key features (WCPFC12-2015-09). It was agreed that the proponents would lead discussions on the proposals in the margins of the meeting before being brought back to plenary for decision. FFA proposal for management of enclosed and semi-enclosed high seas areas"
WCPFC12,157,"FFA members noted the main points of the explanatory note in WCPFC12-2015-DP05, commenting that they had been raising serious concerns about IUU fishing on the high seas for years, particularly in regards to the high seas pockets surrounded by developing country EEZs on which they had consistently sought action. These CCMs noted some recent cases of vessels seen in high seas pockets that were not reporting to VMS or on approved vessel lists; the proposal seeks to improve monitoring and control of vessels fishing in these sensitive areas by turning all five of these enclosed and almost-enclosed areas into Special Management Areas. These CCMs used the wording of CMM 2010-02 for the Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area as a template, with the only substantive differences the areas in which it applies and the addition of a ban on transhipment in these five areas. FFA members see this as essential as high seas transhipment has been shown to be a major IUU risk for the region, and the pockets in particular."
WCPFC12,158,There was no initial discussion on this proposal. The Chair advised the Commission that Vanuatu would lead on this proposal and work with interested members in the margins of the meeting. FFA proposal for enhanced port-based MCS measures
WCPFC12,159,"FFA members introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP10, to establish a clear process that enables CCMs to request assistance from port states and, in taking a risk-based approach, to help direct available resources. These CCMs considered this proposal to be a good first step in the development of broader port based MCS measures in the region, and noted that the proposal has been considered and revised through the TCC and WCPFC over the last two years and was at a stage where CCMs should be comfortable. FFA members welcomed the adoption of the CCSBT Resolution for a Scheme for Minimum Standards for Inspection in Port, and stated that it was similar to the current proposal which they hoped indicated that Commission members were now able to adopt a port inspection measure. FFA members noted that SIDS need resources and assistance to build their capacity to implement port-based MCS mechanisms to support CCMs requiring FFA members’ assistance in deterring IUU fishing. These CCMs noted the presence of members that have established port-based inspection schemes, and asked for their expertise and support to strengthen their own. FFA members identified specific areas for assistance (para. 22) and in a delegation paper submitted for discussion under agenda item 8."
WCPFC12,160,There was no initial discussion on this proposal. The Chair advised the Commission that Tonga would lead on this proposal and work with interested members in the margins of the meeting. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)25  USA proposed revisions to VMS SSPs related to ALC type approval
WCPFC12,161,"USA introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP13, a proposal to modify the VMS SSPs. The proposal was based on work done at TCC, and seeks to ensure that the Commission has a mechanism for removing approval for units that cannot actively communicate with the Commission VMS."
WCPFC12,162,There was no initial discussion on this proposal.  EU proposal for amendment of Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission.
WCPFC12,163,"EU introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP17, to make clearer the obligations under the scientific data provision measure to address issues TCC encountered when assessing certain obligations. The proposal sought to clarify that there are mandatory data to be transmitted to the Commission, sought to address the transmission of operational level catch and effort data, clarified roles across the states. In addition, the attachment had been modified. EU noted that it had received comments and invite CCMs to provide their views with a view to posting a revision as soon as possible."
WCPFC12,164,"RMI thanked EU for the proposed and support the intent of the proposal, given its direct link to New Zealand’s proposal on data rules. RMI requested that both proposals go to SC for review and advice."
WCPFC12,165,"Fiji supported this view, noting that it would impact on information on key tuna species and enquired how the extra data would impact fishing operations."
WCPFC12,166,The Chair directed CCMs to provide the EU with comments on the proposal. EU proposal for fisheries and access agreement information measure
WCPFC12,167,"EU introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP18, a proposal for a measure which would provide fisheries and access agreement information, noting that this was not the first time it had been proposed. The purpose was to increase transparency in the region of agreements between parties on access, which would be made public and provide information that would support the fight against IUU fishing. EU noted that similar arrangements had been adopted in IOTC and ICCAT and commented that it would be good practice to introduce similar practices in WCPFC."
WCPFC12,168,"FSM objected to the proposed measure, noting that the proposal continued to come back to the Commission with no amendments being made. Such a proposal had been rejected in 2013, there were substantive discussions despite objections in 2014. This CCM stated that the proposal had not taken into account some of the comments made, especially around commercial sensitivities."
WCPFC12,169,"The EU noted that it was happy to receive comments and take them into consideration for integration into the measure. EU recalled getting general statements previously, rather than suggested amendments or concrete comments, and noted it was not opposed to changes.  USA proposal for a list of obligations to be assessed during the CMS process"
WCPFC12,170,"USA introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP20_rev1, which detailed the work done in TCC to develop a list of obligations. The work was requested by TCC11, which USA led, and several members submitted their comments. USA noted that there were obligations on the proposed list that had not been assessed in the past. USA called for CCMs to contact the US delegation in the margins with suggestions on the list. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)26"
WCPFC12,171,"RMI commented that, as the proposal was for a binding measure, CMM 2013-06 and CMM 2013-07 needed to be taken into account."
WCPFC12,172,"USA noted that to reduce redundancies it had included one of the two measures on the list of obligations to be reviewed, and the specific matter to be assessed was the same in both measures. As it was not a proposal for a permanent measure but was instead work requested by TCC, USA wondered about the applicability of CMM 2013-06, noting that FFA had contributed a great deal to the list of obligations being presented."
WCPFC12,173,The Chair suggested that the TCC items be taken up when the TCC report is submitted to the Commission (agenda item 12.3) and that comments should be directed to the USA in the margins. TCC work plan
WCPFC12,174,"Australia introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP21, a TCC work plan for 2016-2018. Australia noted that it supercedes the Commission’s 2013-2015 work plan, which was due to expire. Australia had taken account of comments received to date and had posted a revised version for the Commission to review."
WCPFC12,175,The Chair directed comments to Australia.  TCC Chair proposal to revise the CMS CMM
WCPFC12,176,"The TCC Vice-Chair, on behalf of the TCC Chair, introduced WCPFC12-2015-20_rev1, proposed revisions to CMM 2014-07, the Compliance Monitoring Scheme measure. The TCC Vice-Chair explained that the proposed revisions seek to improve the compliance monitoring process to better suit the needs of the Commission, both in assessing compliance with obligations and to work towards improving the ability of all members to implement measures. Key proposed amendments are to consider the special capacity development needs of SIDS, Philippines and Indonesia when assessing compliance, and consideration of the assessment of flag states on obligations where there are ongoing investigations with timeframes not compatible with TCC reporting dates. There is a proposed amendment to reporting dates related to the compliance monitoring process, and ongoing discussions around the decision making process, and dates for a review of the measure and term of the measure. The TCC Vice-Chair noted that some matters were being worked through and an SWG would be taking up the discussions. It was noted that no CMM 2013-06 assessment for this measure had been undertaken, but the TCC Vice-Chair undertook to complete it in the coming days with the assistance of FFA."
WCPFC12,177,The Chair directed interested members to the TCC Vice-Chair to continue discussions. Proposal to revise CMM 2009-06 regarding transshipment
WCPFC12,178,"The IWG-ROP Chair (Ray Clarke, USA) introduced WP21a, noting that IWG-ROP4 had provided some recommendations on high seas transshipment monitoring, based on a paper prepared by the Secretariat (WCPFC-2015-IWG-ROP4-07). Proposed amendment 2009-06 to establish additional reporting requirements for receiving vessels (Attachment 5 of the IWG-ROP report), allowing the movements of observers to be monitored. The IWG-ROP Chair noted that the working group had, as guidelines, a suggested format for reporting to the Secretariat. Taking TCC’s editorial suggestions on the proposal into account and discussions with the Commission Chair, Commission Circular 2015/82 went to CCMs highlighting the proposed changes, which are outlined in WCPFC12-2015-21a. In response to a request for clarification, the IWG-ROP Chair directed CCMs to the working paper, where the language from the working group and a suggested revision in the box for easy reading were included. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)27"
WCPFC12,179,"RMI noted the proposal had highlighted the safety of observers, commenting that safety was paramount but it might be better to fix transshipment issues then look at the observer issues around transshipment. It was noted that the issue was the transshipment activity itself."
WCPFC12,180,"The IWG-ROP Chair explained where the language came from, noting that the IWG-ROP had specifically focused on the need to know whether observers were present on carriers or not – that the Secretariat knew they were onboard. It was suggested that the observer work and the transshipment work could be consolidated and dealt with at the same time."
WCPFC12,181,The Chair noted the linkages between ROP and transshipment issues.
WCPFC12,182,"RMI noted its intent to seek to consolidate them, and encouraged a general discussion to highlight the problem."
WCPFC12,183,The Chair suggested this be undertaken during the TCC or ROP agenda items.
WCPFC12,184,"RMI noted that there are two possibilities regarding transshipment which could be considered through the WCPFC12 proceedings – banning transshipments in the high seas or tightening monitoring of transshipment in the high seas, and increasing observer placements. RMI hoped to make those links and stated it would come back to plenary with an agreed way forward on transshipment.  AGENDA ITEM 6 – INTRODUCTION OF THE IUU VESSEL LIST RECOMMENDATIONS"
WCPFC12,185,"The TCC Vice-Chair, , introduced the relevant TCC11 recommendations relating to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List (WCPFC12-2015-10_rev2):  Para. 51. TCC11 agreed to include the FAIMANU V on the Provisional IUU vessel list.  Para. 66. A majority of TCC members supported the inclusion of the RONG DA YANG 28 on the provisional IUU list whilst a minority were against the inclusion of the RONG DA YANG 28 on the Provisional IUU List. TCC11 agreed to place the vessel on the IUU list with a note to WCPFC12 that consensus was not reached on this vessel.  Para. 76. TCC11 agreed to include the LADY EVELYN-8, the FV MASTER RUSTIN-4, the LADY EVELYN 38 and the LADY GELAINE 18 on the Provisional IUU list. In paragraphs 84, 85 and 89, TCC11 agreed to recommend to WCPFC12 that the NEPTUNE, the FU LIEN No.1 and the YU FONG 168 should remain on the WCPFC IUU vessel list."
WCPFC12,186,"FSM gave an update about the Philippines-flagged vessels which had been placed on the WCPFC Provisional IUU Vessel List for illegally fishing in the FSM EEZ – LADY EVELYN 8, F/V MASTER RUSTIN 4, LADY EVELYN 38 and LADY GELAINE 18. FSM acknowledged the Philippines government for the cooperative efforts in resolving the matter and advised the Commission that it had reached an agreement with the Philippines settling the matter. Consequently, FSM wrote to the Secretariat on 27 November 2015 to seek the removal of the vessels from the Provisional IUU Vessel List. This letter was circulated to CCMs. FSM advised that the Philippines had committed to putting in place binding measures to strengthen monitoring and compliance of their flagged vessels when operating in the High Seas Pockets to prevent further violations of FSM fisheries laws. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)28"
WCPFC12,187,Philippines thanked FSM for its goodwill and for lending support and vital information which enabled the Philippines to further its duty as a flag state and ensure their flagged vessels follow the rules. This CCM acknowledged the support of the WCPFC Chair and Executive Director for their advice.
WCPFC12,188,"Tonga and China stated that they had reached an agreement on the issue of the Chinese-flagged vessel RONG DA YANG 28, and Tonga would not be pursuing the IUU listing of the vessel."
WCPFC12,189,Fiji and France agreed to consult during the meeting in relation to Wallis and Futuna to try and resolve the issue during WCPFC12.
WCPFC12,190,The Commission continued discussion of the 2016 WCPFC IUU List in the margins of the meeting with a view to bringing final decisions back to plenary under agenda item 14 to adopt an IUU Vessel List.  AGENDA ITEM 7 – OBSERVER SAFETY
WCPFC12,191,"The Chair noted that observer safety has been a priority for some time now in the Commission and was the subject of intense discussions at TCC and the IWG-ROP this year, but this was the first Commission meeting which had elevated the issue to a separate high level agenda item."
WCPFC12,192,"The Commission Observer Program Coordinator, Karl Staisch, presented information on the issue of the safety and security of fisheries observers to facilitate discussions regarding the safeguarding of the safety and security of observers. The supporting paper for discussions on observer safety was WCPFC12-2015-11. It was noted that fisheries observers play a critically important role in the fisheries management process, providing fundamental scientific information and serving an indispensable role in monitoring the compliance of CMMs, national fisheries laws and being the eyes and ears for their country and the region. ROP observers need to have the training, tools and skills they need to do their job effectively, and work in an environment that is free from threats, harassment, intimidation and assault. Staisch noted that technology was available for a personal electronic device to be carried which offers a primary source of direct independent communications between the observer provider and observers onboard the vessels. The Secretariat provided information in Annex 1 on indicative costs and technological solutions. With the acceptance of the use of personal communicators for observers, an Emergency Action Plan which details observer programme/provider responses to emergencies involving observers will also be required. The working paper makes a suggestion to strengthen the Secretariat’s support of national observer programs to ensure the safety at sea of observers and contains four recommendations in para. 25, the costs of which are negligible."
WCPFC12,193,The Chair suggested that the recommendations could be considered here but also later in the agenda.
WCPFC12,194,"On behalf of WWF, the Association for Professional Observers, Birdlife International, Humane Society International, Greenpeace, Conservation International, and The Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF stressed that observer health and safety must come first and foremost, and that ensuring the collection by observers of the highest quality data is imperative for the successful and sustainable management of the tuna fisheries, and that this cannot be ensured if observers are forced to endure any kind of harassment, threats, intimidation or assault. WWF stressed that observers are husbands and fathers, wives and mothers, brothers and sisters, and named a number of experienced and professional observers that have tragically gone missing in the Pacific under suspicious circumstances. WWF noted that both vessels involved in Keith Davis’s incident are licensed to fish in the WCPO, and owned and flagged by WCPFC member states. WWF highlighted the good analysis put forward by the Commission with WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)29  recommendations that will help ensure the safety and security of observers deployed at sea, and encouraged their adoption at WCPFC12. However, these observer organisations noted that the analysis must require that in addition to disappearances, any assaults should be reported immediately to the WCPFC under the reporting standards, noting that physical assault is often the last step before a preventable tragedy. WWF addressed the cost of the technology necessary to protect observers and highlighted that the capital and operational costs for 2-way satellite communicators for each observer in the first year would be roughly equivalent to two good-sized yellowfin tuna at current market rates. These observer organisations noted that they were encouraged by the independent efforts of those observer programs and providers that have independently sought to implement the use of two-way satellite communicators by observers in WCPFC and IATTC. WWF commented that the Commission owes their observers the tools and skills they need to do their job effectively and free from threats, harassment, intimidation and assault."
WCPFC12,195,"USA agreed that the health and safety of the fisheries observers was of paramount importance and gladly supported the implementation of the recommendations as well as looking at other ways to ensure their safety, noting that the USA’s standards were higher than what is in place in the ROP and there may be some ideas from that jurisdiction that may be useful to consider implementing."
WCPFC12,196,"FFA members generally supported the recommendations outlined in the Secretariat paper and expressed the need for the Commission to urgently develop mechanisms and processes that promote and addresses observer safety and welfare concerns, including a review of current standards, procedures and guidelines for the ROP to effectively address observer safety concerns and inclusion of the proposed two new minimum standards for “Observer safety at sea” and “Emergency Action Plan” in the WCPFC Minimum Standards of the Regional Observer Programme. FFA members expressed their support for the pre-notification proposal recommended by IWG-ROP4, to enhance efforts to provide better support observer safety and security in line. FFA members noted concerns about the lack of commitment and inaction by CCMs to adequately manage reported incidents of obstruction, intimidation and threats made against observers. As observer providers, FFA members signalled their intention to undertake a comprehensive review of their procedures and mechanisms around safety issues in 2016."
WCPFC12,197,"Korea recognised the safety of onboard observer as an important issue, noting observers can be exposed to violence. This CCM extended deep sympathies to those who have faced such incidents. Korea noted that it has very strong legislative tools to deal with this issue, with provisions addressing the mistreatment or obstruction of observers and subjecting operators to criminal penalties and seeking to ensure that vessels operators continue training crews on issues of observer safety. This CCM wanted the Commission to find constructive ways to ensure safety on board, and was glad to be engaging with CCMs and contributing to the discussions."
WCPFC12,198,"Japan noted that among other things observers collect very important information for stock assessment, and the safety of observers must be ensured. In this respect, flag states and observer provider CCMs need to cooperate on observer safety issues. In relation to the Secretariat paper (WCPFC12-2015-11), Japan generally supported its approach but noted that the action plan had something which needed to be discussed further, particularly around remedial action; which requires Observer program to establish appropriate measures for addressing violations made against observers including a schedule of fines, and/or other punitive measures against captains or crew found to be guilty. This CCM requested more careful drafting of the remedial action, stating that it is the flag state’s responsibility to provide penalties to its fishers. This CCM commented that it was difficult for the flag state to punish fishers under domestic law without supporting information on the observer’s claim, stating that there have been misunderstandings on occasion between observers and crews which in some cases can lead to the observer feeling harassed. To prevent misunderstandings, this CCM noted importance of cross checking between observers and crews. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)30"
WCPFC12,199,"FFA members noted that intimidation, obstruction and assault of observers is against the national law of all FFA member states, for some members it is a criminal offence with severe penalties. These CCMs advised that there had been several cases where an FFA member has undertaken legal proceedings against a vessel operator and crew for such offences, and resolved to increase their vigilance, including through using the regional tools at their disposal such as the immediate suspension of vessels on the FFA Vessel Register where there are reports of such behaviour, and called on flag states to join them in these efforts."
WCPFC12,200,"Philippines noted that it was both an observer provider and a flag state, and joined other delegations in the collective effort to ensure the welfare and safety of Commission observers. This CCM recalled that TCC11 had heard about the case of a PNG national, an observer on a Philippines-flagged vessel, who was allegedly murdered in 2010. At TCC, Philippines had committed to conducting an inquiry into the case, and it learned during this inquiry that on the night this observer went missing the captain had taken steps to locate him and six Philippines crew had been indicted in PNG, with hearings conducted in November 2010. The court found insufficient evidence to commit them to trial for murder and there was no further investigation of the case. It was noted that PNG investigated and Philippines cooperated with that investigation. Philippines acknowledged it still is not sure what happened that night. This CCM reiterated that the safety of the observer is priority and it will continue to take measures to ensure their safety and security, noting that the responsibilities of flag states should be included in these discussions."
WCPFC12,201,"Australia agreed with others on the importance of the issue of observer safety. The Commission relies heavily on the scientific and monitoring data collected by observers in order to meet its objectives and it should go without saying that observers must be able to do their jobs unimpeded and in a safe working environment, free from threats and intimidation. This CCM noted the responsibility of flag States in this regard thanked Korea and others for the information on the legislative instruments that they have implemented. These send a powerful message. This CCM noted the number of comments supporting a cooperative effort and to this end and suggested that the recommendations could be expanded to include flag States."
WCPFC12,202,"Chinese Taipei noted its general support for the working paper, including the emergency Action Plan minimum standards. This CCM hoped to have more focused discussions on the details."
WCPFC12,203,PNG noted that it was the largest observer provider in the region and takes the safety of its nationals and nationals of other countries that provide observers to vessels in PNG waters. This CCM considered that loss of life should be a category of its own. PNG reiterated that its places the safety of observers at the highest possible level and took exception to any suggestion otherwise. This CCM maintains open case files on observers that have gone missing.
WCPFC12,204,"RMI noted all the discussions on observer safety and the commitments which had been made by CCMs and their general support of the recommendations and understood that to mean that there will be no abuse, intimidation or obstruction of observers from here on, and that at TCC13 there are no reports that observers had been subjected to these issues. This CCM noted that preventative measures are important and the recommendations were sound. RMI hoped CCM would take these messages back to their captains and crews and others involved that they take the issue seriously lightly."
WCPFC12,205,The Chair noted that WCPFC12 had not yet reached consensus on the issue and the agenda item would be left open in order for the recommendations to be further considered.
WCPFC12,206,On 5 December plenary resumed discussions on the observer safety issue considering the set of recommendations contained at para. 25 of WCPFC12-2015-11. The Chair highlighted the WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)31  recommendation in 25(a) to adopt two new minimum standards which would be required for implementation no later than 1 January 2017.
WCPFC12,207,"Japan commented that improvement was needed in the contents of the emergency action plan, with more consideration, especially around the relationship between the flag state and the CCM of the observer provider. This CCM asked for clarification whether adopting the recommendation in 25(a) meant that all the elements of the emergency action plan would also be adopted without any modification."
WCPFC12,208,The Chair clarified that this would be the case if 25(a) was adopted. Japan responded that it was difficult to adopt the original emergency action plan.
WCPFC12,209,"A number of CCMs had concerns about the remedial action aspect of the Emergency Action Plan for Observer Safety, and suggested changes to the second sentence of that sub-topic, emphasising that it was the flag state’s responsibility to provide penalties."
WCPFC12,210,"RMI sought clarification about these concerns, commenting that this recommendation was notwithstanding laws and regulations about observer safety which existed at the national level."
WCPFC12,211,The Chair clarified that the recommendation was directed at the observer provider and nothing in it pre-empts the national program from their normal processes.
WCPFC12,212,Korea suggested that the Commission may need to adopt minimum standards to help the observer program establish its own remedial action plans.
WCPFC12,213,"With amendments requested by Japan about 1) deletion of the second sentence of the remedial action and 2) inclusion of enforcement authority of the flag CCM in the follow up response action, the Commission agreed to the recommendation in 25(a)."
WCPFC12,214,"The Commission adopted two new minimum standards for ""Observer safety at sea"" and ""Emergency Action Plan"" for inclusion in the WCPFC Minimum Standards of the Regional Observer Programme, with an implementation date of no later than 1 January 2017 (Attachment F)."
WCPFC12,215,The Commission agreed to consider ways of strengthening the two proposals recommended by the IWG-ROP4 related to pre-notification process from observer providers (WCPFC12-2015-21b) and additional reporting requirements for carrier vessels operating in the Convention Area (WCPFC12-2015-21a) to complement and enhance efforts to provide better support to observer safety and security.
WCPFC12,216,"At the outset of the discussions around 25(c) - strengthening of reporting mechanisms in instances of interference, intimidation, threats, assault, or disappearance of observers – the Chair suggested that this would be something the entire Commission reports."
WCPFC12,217,"RMI noted that in considering the discussions on this issue that the Commission as a body places a high priority on observer safety, and takes on responsibilities including undertaking future work. There should be nil reports of incidents against observer’s wellbeing and, on principle, these incidences will never happen again."
WCPFC12,218,"The Commission agreed to support the strengthening of the reporting mechanisms within the Commission and among CCMs regarding instances of interference, intimidation, threats, assault, or disappearance of observers. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)32"
WCPFC12,219,"As an observer provider under the ROP, the FFA Secretariat commented that these recommendations focus on observer providers strengthening their procedures, but flag states needed to take the issue more seriously too. The FFA Secretariat expressed disappointment that the proposal relating to provision of reports to captains was so summarily dismissed, on the basis that it was not written down. It was noted that there had been prior discussions about the issue."
WCPFC12,220,USA commented that as an observer provider as well as a flag and coastal state it supported the recommendations. The USA has an active and thorough observer program and would be willing to assist the Secretariat if it receives a tasking to intensify its support to national observer programmes.
WCPFC12,221,"The Chair noted that we are talking about our own people, there is an expectation that this issue is not up for debate and there is clearly a dual responsibility."
WCPFC12,222,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to intensify its support to national observer programmes to strengthen and enhance their capability in the areas of observer safety and security, including in support to safety at sea operations."
WCPFC12,223,FFA members asked that the Commission to request TCC12 to develop a conservation and management measure to guide flag CCMs’ response to emergency situations in the event of alleged observer safety incidents.
WCPFC12,224,"Japan requested that consideration would include observer providers’ responsibility, noting that not all incidences happen because of responsibility of vessel crew side only: some incidences happen because of miscommunications and misunderstandings between observers and vessel crews. This CCM commented that the existing system only has the observer reporting and sought a fair approach by including observer providers’ responsibility."
WCPFC12,225,It was noted that it is not TCC’s role to draft CMMs and unless a draft was prepared by the Secretariat a CCM would need to take the lead. Another CCM observed that this was about providing flag states with some guidance with how to go about the process should there occur an alleged observer safety incident.
WCPFC12,226,Korea suggested that the IWG-ROP be continued and tasked to draft a CMM for consideration at TCC.
WCPFC12,227,"The Chair noted that the issue under discussion was about tasking future work to strengthen the support the Commission gives to fisheries observers and that support should come from all sides and from anyone with an interest in protecting our own people. The Chair suggested that the Commission agree that additional work needs to take place, taking into account the responsibilities of all parties involved, with perhaps a CCM taking the lead."
WCPFC12,228,USA supported the Chair’s remarks framing the task and volunteered to take on the task of drafting a CMM on this issue. The Philippines wished to work with the USA on this document.
WCPFC12,229,"The Chair noted the clear support to continuing to strengthen responses on this matter, and noted that it would be revisited at TCC with attention kept on it through 2016."
WCPFC12,230,The Commission agreed that a CMM should be drafted for TCC12’s consideration and finalisation and WCPFC13’s deliberation on flag state responsibilities in the event of alleged observer safety.  The USA kindly offered to lead this work.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)33

WCPFC12,232,"The Chair outlined that the discussions on the tropical tuna measure (including in the SWG) would take into account a general overview of stock status, the work of the subsidiary bodies on this issue, and the new proposals. 9.1  General overview of stock status (Skipjack, Yellowfin, and Bigeye)"
WCPFC12,233,"J. Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented a summary of the status of tropical tuna fisheries and stocks. It was noted that more detailed information is available in Tuna Fisheries Assessment Report No. 15, which can be found at www.spc.int/oceanfish. The total catch of tuna in the WCPFC Convention Area was a record in 2014, approximately 2.9 million t. The purse seine catch (2 million t) and the catch of skipjack (almost 2 million t) were also records. Catches of yellowfin tuna (600,000 t) and bigeye tuna (161,000 t) were similar to recent years. Purse seine effort appears to have reduced in 2015, on the evidence of VMS data, possibly due to economic conditions in the fishery. The distribution of purse seine effort has moved strongly to the east, in response to the current El Nino event, which is the strongest since 1987/88. Purse seine catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was relatively high through 2014 and in the first half of 2015, but declined somewhat during the FAD closure. Longline catch in 2014 increased slightly in spite of a reported decrease in effort. Consequently, CPUE for both bigeye and yellowfin tuna is reported to have increased strongly in 2014. As longline data for the most recent year are often revised, this observation is considered to be preliminary."
WCPFC12,234," The status of tropical tuna stocks was summarised as follows: • Skipjack catch has increased continuously over a long period of time, and depletion of the spawning biomass is now estimated to have reached 50% of the unexploited level. The stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. • Yellowfin tuna catch has levelled off since the late 1990s, and depletion of the spawning biomass is estimated to be around 38% of the unexploited level. The stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. • Bigeye tuna catch has been flat since the late 1990s, and depletion of the spawning biomass is estimated to have reached 16% of the unexploited level, i.e. beneath the limit reference point of 20% of the unexploited level. The stock is considered to be overfished and overfishing is occurring."
WCPFC12,235,EU commented that the data used for assessment are from the period 2011/2012 which made it difficult to ascertain whether the adopted measure is having an impact or not.
WCPFC12,236,SPC noted that this would be addressed in the next SPC presentation.
WCPFC12,237,Indonesia noted its appreciation to SPC for providing stock assessments. This CCM commented that SPC also provided stock assessment based on the region but that information was not presented here.
WCPFC12,238,SPC noted that its assessments provide information on different levels of exploitation and metrics by subregion; the presentation at WCPFC12 had just been shortened. The information requested by Indonesia was available in the stock assessment reports presented to SC10; there was also information available in the Tuna Fisheries Assessment Report No. 15. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)34
WCPFC12,239,"In response to a question from EU about the reduction in effort on VMS days presented, Hampton commented that some vessels may have left the region compared to previous years, and some vessels may be staying in port for longer periods of time, noting the difficult economic conditions in the purse-seine fishery at the moment due to low fish prices. Evaluation of CMM 2014-01 for bigeye tuna"
WCPFC12,240,"G. Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented WPCFC12-2015-12, an evaluation of CMM 2014-01 for bigeye tuna, both the performance of the fishery components (purse seine and longline) against the measure as written for 2014, and the potential for the CMM as written for 2017 to achieve its objective of removing bigeye overfishing. The evaluation indicated that purse-seine FAD set numbers and longline bigeye catch levels in 2014 were ‘provisionally on track’ with the levels of effort and bigeye catch anticipated to arise under the CMM specifications for that year. A separate analysis examined whether full implementation of the CMM, under the conditions specified for 2017 would ultimately removing overfishing of bigeye tuna. The challenge was that it was not possible to define precisely what levels of purse-seine effort and longline catch would result in 2017, due to “either/or” choices within the CMM (e.g. purse-seining CCMs could choose between a three month FAD closure and overall FAD limit, or a four month FAD closure), exemptions and exclusions, and decisions yet to be made. Three different scenarios for 2017 conditions were therefore used to examine this implementation uncertainty, but Pilling noted that there is no certainty any of them will be correct. The scenarios were: ‘pessimistic’; ‘2015 choices’; and ‘optimistic’. Only under the ‘optimistic’ scenario were CMM objectives achieved by 2032, with F less than FMSY and the risk of the spawning biomass being below the LRP at 2%. Examining the trajectory of F/FMSY assuming the optimistic scenario conditions remained in place after 2017, CMM 2014-01 objectives would be achieved on average 10 years after the end of the measure, i.e. in 2027. As WCPFC stock assessments generally report fishing mortality conditions three years in the past, this would imply that only in 2030 would stock assessments identify whether the CMM had been successful. However, Pilling noted that earlier stock assessments should identify if the trajectory of F/FMSY and risk of SB < LRP are ‘on track’ to achieve objectives."
WCPFC12,241,"EU thanked SPC for the presentation and requested that in the future, consultation takes place with members to allow them to contribute to the definition of scenarios to be considered and explored through projections to ensure the provision of a wider range of options and advice. This CCM commented that it would have been useful to have had a projection with the modalities of each year of the measure, the effect of the total FAD closure and hotspot analysis. Noting that the objective of the measure is to maintain the three stocks at MSY at a minimum, the EU asked a number of questions: how many years it would take to reach MSY, to clarify whether the projection was based on the assumption of a total FAD closure on the high seas, whether an indication is available of bigeye tuna recruitment from 2011, based on the recent projections, what level of recruitment was used in the 2014 projections, whether there were bigeye tuna hotspots in the high seas."
WCPFC12,242,"Hampton explained that the reason certain areas were identified as catch ‘hotspots’ is because that is where the majority of purse-seine fishing took place within the tropical WCPO. However, when considering hotspots in terms of catch per set, these were to the east of the tropical WCPO. Hampton noted that the largest bigeye tuna reduction by removing a certain number of FADs sets would therefore be achieved in the eastern area, where CPUE is considerably higher than in the western area, in the order of five times the CPUE."
WCPFC12,243,"Pilling explained that the spawning biomass at MSY is estimated to be slightly larger than that at the LRP. The results of the projections under the three scenarios examined within the projections would be close to SBMSY, but there would still be a high probability of the stock being below that level. As overall fishing levels were generally reduced within the scenarios, skipjack and yellowfin tuna should WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)35  remain above the SBMSY level. In the previous analysis of CMM 2013-01, SPC conducted the evaluation as the measure was written, before decisions about the fifth month FAD closure and other elements were subsequently taken. In turn, the high seas FAD closure was assumed to lead to those FAD sets moving inside zones. If the high seas FAD set ban (para 18) was implemented on its own, it removed 18% of the overfishing of bigeye tuna within the analysis. Addressing EU’s comment about multi-species issues, SPC noted that within the modelling, the overall purse seine effort was maintained, and reductions in FAD sets led to commensurate increases in free school sets. Previous analyses have shown that there was relatively little impact in shifting effort from FAD sets to free school sets for skipjack and yellowfin. Addressing the query about whether bigeye tuna recruitment patterns were consistent with the recruitment scenario assumed, Hampton noted that it was difficult to monitor recruitment in recent time periods; as the information comes from the stock assessments, the most recent estimates are more uncertain. Although SPC did not have a concrete assessment on recent recruitment levels, some information suggests that there could be higher recruitment coming through."
WCPFC12,244,"PNA members saw the assessments of the purse-seine and longline provisions as reflecting some positive trends in the tropical fisheries, with purse-seine effort declining, especially in PNA EEZs under the VDS. These CCMs noted that the 2-year average number of FAD sets in the area where the FAD closure was being applied was down by 14% in 2013 and 2014 – more than was expected from the additional fourth month of closure – and it was noted that effort is declining in the tropical longline fishery. However, the analysis also showed that these gains will probably not meet the objective of removing overfishing of bigeye tuna and PNA members observed that the paper made it clear that additional measures were necessary in both the longline and purse-seine fisheries."
WCPFC12,245,The FFA Secretariat asked about the time frames under each of the scenarios to get back above the LRP.
WCPFC12,246,"Pilling explained that SPC had modelled the high seas FAD closure as removing the equivalent number of FAD sets from the fishery. In response to the question from the FFA Secretariat about the time it will take the stock to recover to the LRP, facilitated by the SC-agreed assumption of more positive recent recruitments continuing into the future, SPC would need to look at the outputs from the projections but it may be relatively comparable between the three scenarios."
WCPFC12,247,Cook Islands thanked SPC for providing goals to assist management and commented that the current CMM was deficient as it was a flag-based rather than zone-based measure; it was indiscriminate and reinforced a system of flag-based rights over zones. This CCM encouraged FAD set allocations on a per zone basis as the Commission moves forward through these discussions.
WCPFC12,248,"FFA members expressed concern that the tropical tuna measure was highly unlikely to achieve its stated objectives because of flaws in both the purse-seine and longline measures and the issue of disproportionate burden. These CCMs identified weaknesses: for longline, the agreed reductions in the catch limits for the big fleets fall short of the SC advice, and that there is nothing preventing substantial growth in catches by other fleets; for purse-seine, the flexibility for flag states to choose between the three and four month FAD closure and the lack of limits on FAD sets outside of the four month FAD closure create the potential for substantial growth in FAD usage. These CCMs noted that these and other weaknesses are artefacts of attempting to apply management measures on a flag state basis, rather than a zone basis. These CCMs stated that when the Commission seeks to set flag-based limits and measures, there is almost always a need for a SIDS exemption as otherwise SIDS would be locked out, and acknowledged that the exemptions weaken the measures and have been exploited by several developed CCMs. FFA members explained that in the purse-seine fishery, the main management measure is zone-based effort limits, so flag-based arrangements for FADs are particularly incompatible. These CCMs WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)36  called for a fundamental change in management approaches to supporting zone-based management, which will also help address the disproportionate burden of FAD closures."
WCPFC12,249,"PNA members supported the SPC paper’s suggestion to consider revising the choice of FAD measures. However they stated that the problem is not simply a matter of the number of FAD sets, noting that the number of FAD sets was down but with no decline in purse-seine bigeye bycatch. PNA provided some proposals in that direction (WCPFC12-2015-DP12). PNA members saw improving the monitoring and verification of the high seas longline fishery as a high priority, noting SPC’s qualifications relating to reliability of the longline bigeye catch data."
WCPFC12,250,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF, Greenpeace, the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, Conservation International and the International Pole and Line Foundation, Pew highlighted the urgent need for discussion and action on bigeye tuna, noting the stock was overfished, with overfishing occurring, and having breached the LRP. These observers stated that actions to date were insufficient to address this situation, and commented that more bigeye tuna was caught in the purse-seine fishery in 2014 than in 2009, when the FAD closure length was half as long. In addition, the overall tonnage of bigeye caught by all gears in the WCPO increased 5% from 2013 to 2014. They noted that the science indicates that the impact of longlines and purse-seine are approximately equal and opined that the fate of the stock cannot continue to be mired in an inability to make the decisions on managing this stock. The observers stated that the status quo is not acceptable and called on CCMs to agree to concretely improve the tropical tuna measure to achieve real reductions in bigeye mortality."
WCPFC12,251,"Japan commented that there was too much optimism around usage of the recent high recruitment because recruitment collapse may occur under the current level of spawning biomass of WCPFO bigeye, which breached the biomass LRP. This CCM took the view that SPC should provide another projection result using average recruitment for reference."
WCPFC12,252,"In response, SPC commented that this question was a critical one: if longer-term recruitment patterns were assumed, which are lower than that estimated for the more recent period, the outcome was more pessimistic. The analysis presented to WCPFC12 assumed recruitment consistent with the more recent period, utilising 2002-2011 recruitment deviations and the stock-recruitment relationship estimated in the 2014 assessment models. This was consistent with the recommendations from the SC, and reflected the improved information on recruitment provided by the commencement of the purse seine fishery that captures smaller fish."
WCPFC12,253,EU asked about the decreasing trend in purse seine effort in 2015 and noted that at SC11 SPC presented a paper on trends in purse-seine CPUE which showed that there seemed to be underreporting of fishing days. EU asked if SPC had explored this issue further.
WCPFC12,254,"Hampton elaborated that when SPC analysed the logbook data there appeared to have been an increasing tendency to declare an increasing proportion of days as in transit, not fishing. SPC was continuing to analyse those trends with the objective of correcting for it. The graphic presented to WCPFC12 which shows the evolution of purse-seine effort on a month by month basis for the years 2009-2015 is based on VMS data and is therefore not subject to the bias, giving a fairly solid estimate of at least that metric of fishing effort."
WCPFC12,255,Japan asked whether the fishing fleet may have moved to the IATTC area or stopped fishing due to low prices for skipjack or high access prices. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)37
WCPFC12,256,"Hampton explained that there was no hard data, and individual vessel behaviour could usefully be investigated. It was understood that some vessels left the fishery this year, some are staying in port longer between trips. These patterns may have been related to depressed economic conditions."
WCPFC12,257,"Indonesia noted the address by the Minister at the opening ceremony and commented that Indonesia now had a moratorium in place, with the aim of reducing fishing effort including for tuna. Seven large scale longliners did not have their fishing licences renewed, but this effort has moved elsewhere in the WCPFC area, meaning that no fishing effort reduction had occurring even though Indonesia reduced its fleet by 7 vessels. This needed to be taken into account."
WCPFC12,258,"RMI noted that the analysis gave the impression of the fishery being on track in 2014 and asked whether for the longline fishery there was enough data for the stock assessments, and whether more was needed."
WCPFC12,259,"Hampton commented that it needs to be understood that the fishery being described as ‘on track’ relates to how the levels of catch are evolving with respect to the way the measures are written. ‘On track’ does not necessarily mean that the long term objectives are going to be met, indeed they are unlikely to be met despite components of the measures being termed ‘on track’. Purse seine FAD option choice, for example, gives the measure a bit of looseness and the analysis reflects that. Hampton noted that in terms of the quality of longline data and the stock assessment, SPC has tried to get better quality operational longline data because they are used as key indices of abundance. Cooperation from the DWFNs is beginning to provide that information for stock assessments. SPC hoped that would continue as a long time series of longline data would make a more useful contribution to the stock assessments."
WCPFC12,260,"Noting the similar impact on the resource in terms of tonnage of both purse-seiners and longliners, Korea asked about whether there was a way to quantify the effect of the exemptions."
WCPFC12,261,"Pilling noted that the effect of exemptions were not analysed within the analysis, commenting that it was very difficult to quantify their impact on catch or effort. It was noted that the measure would perform more poorly than was currently evaluated if those exemptions were quantified and included within the analysis."
WCPFC12,262,"In response to a question from Indonesia about the decrease in VMS days in 2015, Hampton reiterated that there is no specific data to point to an explanation for this but it could relate to the economic conditions in the fishery, with boats spending longer in port, not fishing."
WCPFC12,263,China noted the scientific data behind the analysis and asked what fishing gear was more responsible for the bigeye tuna stock condition – longline or purse-seine. China also asked what kind of measures should be taken to have a more direct influence on restoring the stock.
WCPFC12,264,"Hampton noted that in the bigeye tuna ‘impact’ plot SPC quantifies the impact of the different fishery components. The impact, in terms of stock depletion, is approximately equally shared between the purse seine FAD set and longline fishery sectors at this point in time. Which one of those fishery sectors should be reduced was not a question for science and there may be many different combinations of reductions that would achieve the objective."
WCPFC12,265,"Pilling referred to Tables 1 and 2 in WCPFC-2015-12, noting that overfishing on bigeye tuna is not removed if the purse-seine and longline sectors remain as they were in 2012 – fishing mortality remained 21% above that at MSY. Because of the recent good recruitments assumed, the model does show the stock recovering above the LRP on average, but there is still a chance that it will remain below. Essentially, if fishing remains at 2012 levels and recruitment remains at recent levels, overfishing on WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)38  bigeye tuna will not be removed – the fishery may recover above the LRP on average, but with a risk (32%, 1 in 3) that it will remain below LRP."
WCPFC12,266,PNA members noted the great importance of ensuring the CMM is effective in meeting objectives for management and conservation of the tropical tunas. These CCMs requested that future evaluations of the measure should include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the measure for skipjack and yellowfin.
WCPFC12,267,"USA made some general comments in response to the discussions, including a request to SPC and the science community that new analyses be done that could help managers make decisions about how best to approach the management of this stock, in particular, the idea of looking at spatial management. This CCM saw the usefulness in receiving input from SPC on how to go about using such a tool, including where mortality is most occurring and reducing mortality in those areas, especially by the longline fleet. USA was interested in work being done on identifying a particular number of FAD sets that each country would be limited to, to see a reduction in bigeye tuna mortality in the purse-seine fleet. USA commented that the Commission needed to ensure the sustainable management of stocks in a fair and equitable fashion, with the Convention clearly providing that the rights of SIDS and participating territories are protected and their right to development of their fisheries and maintain their fisheries-related industries. This CCM noted with concern the impact that the tropical tuna measure had on the tuna industry and peoples in American Samoa and commented that when we adopt future measures, whether revisions to CMM 2014-01 or a new tropical tuna measure, these issues need to be taken into account, including the disproportionate impact caused by eliminating fishing on the high seas in favour of fishing in the zones of states."
WCPFC12,268,"In response to the USA’s comment, EU asked for clear mandate to SPC about what work would be required."
WCPFC12,269,Indonesia asked about the three scenarios and the purse-seine and longline sectors having similar impacts and asked what factor affected the model the most.
WCPFC12,270,"Pilling noted that the relative multipliers for purse seine and longline fisheries used in the model are not equivalent. A 20% reduction in the purse-seine sector is not the same as a 20% reduction in the longline sector, as the former would be applied to purse seine FAD effort, and the latter to longline catch levels. The same scalar applied to both fishery components does not mean the same level of overfishing removed on the stock."
WCPFC12,271,"Japan noted the discussions and stated that bigeye tuna fishing grounds around Japan have diminished, with skipjack migration to the waters around Japan drastically decreased due to failure of conservation effort. This was causing severe economic problems in Japanese coastal fishing communities. This CCM noted that it had raised this point for some years but the Commission has not introduced a concrete measure to accommodate these concerns."
WCPFC12,272,The Chair suggested that these discussions continue in the SWG looking at the measure. 9.2  Review of purse seine fishery measures (Paragraphs 14-29 of CMM 2014-01) and longline fishery measures (Paragraphs 40-44 of CMM 2014-01)
WCPFC12,273,"The Chair noted that a number of WCPFC subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups included a number of recommendations which would facilitate a review by the Commission of CMM 2014-01 and the SWG which was established to further this review, focusing on the provisions for the purse-seine fishery (paras. 14-29) and the longline fishery (paras. 40-44). The Chair talked through WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)39  recommendations from SC and TCC (WCPFC13) to be taken up in the SWG.  Reference document WCPFC12-2015-13 was noted to contain the relevant recommendations.  SC11 recommendations"
WCPFC12,274,There were no objections to accepting the SC recommendations on this measure.  TCC11 recommendations
WCPFC12,275,"TCC11 had provided three recommendations prioritised by CMS process which were ambiguous or problematic: TCC11 Summary Report para 483: Due to its inability to assess CMM 2013-01, paragraph 28 (yellowfin tuna purse seine catch), TCC11 recommends that WCPFC12 agree that until appropriate limits have been formulated and adopted, this obligation should not be included as part of the assessment.  TCC11 Summary Report para 483: Based on its review of CMM 2013-01, paragraphs 49, 51 and 52, TCC11 recommends that the Commission clarify what is meant by the term “current” in each of these paragraphs by stating a specified baseline.  TCC11 Summary Report para 485: TCC11 recommends that WCPFC12 consider clarifying how to assess CMM 2013-01 paragraph 40 with regards to compliance and that the paragraph be revised to separate the catch limit obligation from the requirement to take remedial action in the following year."
WCPFC12,276,"Japan opined that the Commission needed to strengthen the measure to improve the condition of the stock and most of the effort should be put into improvement of the existing measure, rather than mixing up the science and compliance issues."
WCPFC12,277,"The Chair noted that the discussions should maintain that distinction, suggesting that when the Commission discusses the measures in terms of strengthening them it should also ensure the obligation is clear. It was noted that the work required of the Commission this year on CMM 2014-01 is to take into account advice from the SC, with TCC not to assess it until the limits are established."
WCPFC12,278,"The EU agreed that they are different issues, but commented that the discussions should also try to address the grey zones to find a solution to avoid problems at TCC.  FADMgmtOptions-IWG recommendations"
WCPFC12,279,The outcomes from the FADMgmtOptions-IWG were discussed under agenda item 12.5. HSW outcomes
WCPFC12,280,"The Chair noted that some of the conclusions of the HSW were relevant to the SWG discussions in the margins, in relation to TRPs."
WCPFC12,281,The outcomes from the HSW were discussed under agenda item 12.6.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)40  New proposals FFA proposal for a target reference point for skipjack tuna
WCPFC12,282,"FFA members presented WCPFC12-2015-DP06, a FFA proposal for a target reference point for skipjack tuna, which was well known, having been discussed at MOW3, SC11, TCC11 and HSW. These members thanked CCMs for the productive discussions and useful questions in the HSW and in an informal session afterwards. They noted gladly that there appeared to be consensus on an interim TRP for skipjack of 50% of the unfished spawning biomass. FFA would be making some minor amendments to the text to reflect the similar proposal from Japan as well as the comments provided by CCMs in the informal session, but were confident the task would not prove overly difficult. FFA would discuss the outstanding items in the proposal in the tropical tuna SWG meeting in the margins, discussions the Chair was leading and which would cover TRPs."
WCPFC12,283,The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions. Japan proposal for a target reference point for skipjack tuna
WCPFC12,284,"Japan noted that its proposal WCPFC12-2015-DP15 was also proposed at WCPFC11. Japan made a statement about the importance of skipjack tuna for Japan, commenting that drastic declines in the skipjack migration had made Japanese local communities fateful crisis. This CCM observed that it had raised this issue on many occasions but the measures produced have not addressed these concerns. Japan stated that most skipjack are caught in the tropical areas and the stock assessment is conducted based on the size of that catch, so the situation in Japanese local communities is not reflected in skipjack stock assessment. Japan noted the chapeau part of Article 5 of the Convention saying that “in order to conserve and manage highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area in their entirety, the members of the Commission shall, in giving effect to their duty to cooperate….” and Article 5(h) taking into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers. In addition to this, Japan made reference to Article 10 paragraph 3 regarding consideration of the historical catch and the needs of coastal communities which are dependent mainly on fishing for the stocks in developing allocation criteria. At WCPFC11, Japan had proposed 60% of the estimated recent spawning biomass in the absence of fishing as the TRP for skipjack considering those factors. While Japan’s basic position has not changed, in the interests of preventing deterioration of the stock due to prolongation of the argument, Japan offered a compromise of a 50% of the estimated recent spawning biomass in the absence of fishing as the initial TRP with a review not later than 2019, based on scientific advice. Japan reported that concerned CCMs had held informal consultations with Japan the week before WCPFC12. This CCM noted that it seemed to be considered that the differences between Japan and the FFA on the issue are small. However, it was not true and was critical for Japan to retain content of paras. 3 and 6 of the proposal."
WCPFC12,285,"In response to a question about SC advice on the range contraction issue, Japan commented that SC did not have the capacity to analyse all phenomena, particular local conditions and range contraction and noted that the Commission did not see what was happening in its local communities. This CCM reiterated that highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area shall be conserved and managed in their entirety as stipulated in the chapeau part of Article 5 of the Convention."
WCPFC12,286,"FFA members commented that they had looked at Japan’s proposal and had accommodated some of Japan’s concerns into the FFA proposal. These CCMs noted Japan’s answers to the CMM 2013-06 questions, which came to the conclusion that a higher TRP would be better for SIDS. These CCMs asked how the rent was calculated and current levels of access revenue. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)41"
WCPFC12,287,"Japan acknowledged that it could not provide 100% accurate information because complete figures are not available, but reiterated that conservation and management of the stocks should be considered comprehensively; the Commission should consider the stocks in their entirety with recognition of interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers, and historical catch and the needs of coastal communities which are dependent mainly on fishing for the stocks."
WCPFC12,288,"A brief discussion took place about the range contraction issue, with one CCM recalling that SC11 had noted that Project 67 had demonstrated no statistical evidence for skipjack range contraction and Japan arguing that SC had not been able to determine local depletion because of the conventional approach. In addition to this, Japan noted the uncertainty that the current stock assessment cannot overcome effort creep. Finally, Japan announced that its scientists elucidated there were three migration courses of skipjack around Japan and the most western one had collapsed. This CCM stated there is a scientific evidence of skipjack range contraction."
WCPFC12,289,"The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions. FFA proposal for strengthening of CMM 2014-01 for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna"
WCPFC12,290,The Chair noted that this proposal (WCPFC12-2015-DP07) had been presented at the HSW and addresses the impact of flag-based choices in the FAD management section of the CMM. It would be considered further in SWG discussions. FFA revised proposal for a harvest strategy workplan
WCPFC12,291,"FFA members introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP09 the harvest strategy workplan, noting that the Commission has worked for a number of years to agree key parameters to guide the sustainable management of Commission area fish stocks. These CCMs noted that WCPFC9 agreed LRPs for bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and skipjack tunas, and the Commission has scientific advice on the implications of possible TRPs for some stocks. WCPFC11 adopted CMM 2014-06 establishing a harvest strategy approach for key fisheries and stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. The proposal captures the requirements in para. 13, for a work plan and timeframes for the development of these harvest strategies. FFA members advised that SC and TCC had provided input as have other experts and CCMs, and the proposal and related elements were covered at HSW. FFA members highlighted some features: the work plan reflects timelines for Commission work, it is not the place to decide issues related to the elements themselves; it is practical, and breaks the work down into logical steps. Australia commented that the FFA proposal for a harvest strategy work plan and timeline (WCPFC12-2015-DP09) was practical, acknowledging there is only so much that can be done in one year. It tries to be logical around the next steps and also recognises that a lot of work has already been done. The proposal asks that an element is introduced into the Commission meeting agenda to review progress."
WCPFC12,292,"China asked about the rationale for the timeframes for the four species, noting that the stock status of the four species were all different. This CCM commented that bigeye tuna has breached the LRP and should be the priority, with urgent work needing to be undertaken, while for the other three species the state of the stock was relatively good."
WCPFC12,293,"Australia, which is leading the work, explained that FFA members had drafted the work plan to reflect the status of bigeye, with the first step for this stock being to seek advice from SC around biologically reasonable timeframes for bigeye tuna. This CCM noted that tasking SC was a necessary first step under the work plan. Timeframes for remaining stocks and fisheries were based on what was achievable and built on existing work and there was no reason to delay development of harvest strategies for other stocks of fisheries until work on bigeye had been completed. The proposal recognised the WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)42  significant amount of work being undertaken on other stocks and invited CCMs to discuss these issues in the margins."
WCPFC12,294,The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions.  The discussions on this proposal were finalised under Agenda 15.   PNA members and Tokelau proposed revisions to the tropical tuna measure (CMM 2014-01)
WCPFC12,295,"PNA members and Tokelau introduced a proposal for revisions to CMM 2014-01 (WCPFC12-2015-DP12), offering a balanced set of measures in the longline and purse-seine fisheries that will improve the chances of removing bigeye overfishing and improving the basis for the management of tropical fisheries generally. These members noted that the major elements in the proposals were supported in principle by a majority of CCMs, and would be complemented by actions by PNA members in their waters. Next year, PNA will begin, on a trial basis, to register and electronically track all FADs in PNA waters, and introduce differential charging for fishing on FADs versus free schools, to create an incentive for fishing on schools not associated with FADs, adding to the incentives created by the MSC certification of the PNA free school skipjack fishery, the presence of the MSC-certified ‘Pacifical’ tuna products, and effort limits applied to longline fishing through the Vessel Day Scheme. The purse-seine proposals included a hard limit on high seas purse seine effort at the 2010 level, compatible with the limits being applied in PNA EEZs, a pre-dawn set ban during the FAD closure, extending coverage to the deployment and servicing of FADs by support vessels, providing for observers to be carried by support vessels, and a requirement for observers on ROP purse-seine trips to be sourced from other CCMs. The longline proposals were designed to address the unreliability of the longline catch data – especially important when catches are transhipped in the high seas, operational data is not provided by some fleets, and the fleets carry their own observers – and included a high seas longline closure, a ban on transhipment of frozen bigeye at sea, no operation under manual reporting when VMS breaks down, and increasing observer coverage on high seas trips to 20% with observers sourced from other CCMs. Other proposals related to capacity management provisions, which had resulted in obstruction of the development of PNA domestic tuna industries. The straightforward proposal revision to the CMM would clarify that construction of vessels for SIDS is not a matter for the Commission."
WCPFC12,296,Indonesia noted that it did not have any objections but noted Article 30 of the Convention which included developing countries such as Indonesia and paras. 49 and 52 of CMM 2013-01 provides opportunity to Indonesia and SIDS to develop fleets. Indonesia reserved its position in this regard.
WCPFC12,297,"EU queried the PNA presentation which referred to an increase of fishing effort in the high seas and noted that only 12% of catches are taken on the high seas; on the other hand it noted an increase of around 10% in catch in EEZs. Referring to WCPFC12-2015-IP02-rev1, this CCM commented that there was 1773 fishing days on the high seas in 2014 when there has been a limit applying under Attachment D of CMM 2014-01 of 2282 (days excluding the Philippines) which corresponds to a level that is 20% below established the limit. If the Philippines effort is taken into account the level in 2014 was still 30% below the limit applying under Attachment D of CMM 2014-01. If we take into account total days by all fleets, including those fleets not subject to the limits in Attachment D, we arrive to 5415 days that have been fished on the high seas which is still below the total hard limit. Looking more historically, in 2001 and 2014 across all fleets 7200 and 5415 days respectively were fished in the high seas whereas historical (2001-2014) average is estimated at 6454 fishing days on the high seas. EU has also pointed out that a CCM not listed under Attachment D of CMM 2014-01 has displayed an increase of its fishing days in the high seas of almost three fold between 2013 and 2014. EU asked PNA to elaborate on these figures in the SWG.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)43"
WCPFC12,298,"RMI noted an increase in catch in the high seas, noting that bigeye tuna from the high seas used to be a relatively small percentage, but this is no longer the case. The high seas share in 2014 over 12% purse-seine effort in the high seas in 2015 has more than doubled, pointing to a problem in the high seas fishery."
WCPFC12,299,"Japan asked that the package be discussed in the SWG.  Japan also asked about explanation of the reason for the combination of measures proposed as a package (for example, “high seas closure equal to FAD closure for high seas vessels” vs “ban on pre-dawn sets”)."
WCPFC12,300,"USA expressed interest in the statements about the increase in effort and bigeye tuna catch on the high seas and asked where and what fleets were responsible, noting the USA fleet was not seeing the same level of increase. In addition, USA asked proponents whether they had looked at what impact further restrictions on fishing on the high seas would have on participating territories."
WCPFC12,301,"The Chair noted that interested parties can take up these questions in the tropical tuna SWG, including discussions to reconcile the data. Japan proposal on joint reduction plan of purse-seine fishing capacity"
WCPFC12,302,Japan explained that this proposal (WCPFC12-2015-DP14_rev1) was aimed to establish a scheme to jointly reduce the capacity of large scale purse-seine vessels flying their flag larger than 24m with freezing capacity between 20N and 20S (LSPSVs) to the level of 31 December 2012 by CCMs other than SIDS as agreed at WCPFC10. Basic concept of proposal was the same as its proposal at WCPFC11: increased number of LSPSVs from that of 31 December 2012 shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis based on the number of LSPSVs flagged to each concerned CCMs as of 31 December 2012. New elements were 1) clarification of the number of vessels (22 - the difference between 31 December 2012 and 29 October 2015); 2) CCMs other than SIDS may transfer the quota; 3) further introduction of LSPSVs by SIDS after 29 October 2015 shall be addressed in 2020. Japan believed that the biggest cause of the failure of conservation effort was that there was no rule to control over-capacity of LSPSVs and looked forward to constructive and rational deliberation on this proposal.
WCPFC12,303,"EU asked about the metrics used in developing the proposal (i.e. number of vessels) and whether the proponent had considered alternatives such as well capacity, which EU considered would be more accurate."
WCPFC12,304,Japan acknowledged the point and said it would be considered during discussions.
WCPFC12,305,The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions. Outcomes of tropical tuna measure CMM 2014-01 SWG discussions
WCPFC12,306,"On the afternoon of 5 December 2015, the Chair reported that in the 4 December tropical tuna SWG meeting, the PNA proposal was discussed, however those discussions did not move the SWG forward. The SWG met again on 5 December to look at these issues from a different perspective but did not make progress on CMM 2014-01. Discussions had begun on the draft harvest strategy work plan but there was no agreement on a skipjack TRP. The Chair advised that the SWG would reconvene on 7 December when the Chair would put forward draft amendments to the measure for the SWG to consider. They were small elements and there would be no surprises. The Chair wanted to put on the record her concern that the working groups were not progressing as delegates had said they wanted to progress, especially the tropical tuna and South Pacific albacore SWGs. The Chair reminded delegates that status quo was not a long term option and the Commission might need to look at other mechanisms. The Chair WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)44  noted that some delegations would welcome a vote on some of these issues, while others would not. The Chair was also investigating the possibility of a conciliation process to work through these issues."
WCPFC12,307,"On 7 December, the Chair advised that she planned to hold a HOD meeting on 8 December to work through the amendments, followed by a HOD+1 meeting for technical drafting. A brief discussion took place as several members preferred that both meetings would be HOD+1. The Chair noted these views and both meetings would be HOD+1. The Chair stressed that these CCMs should come ready to be constructive to move the measure forward. SPC, FFA and PNA Secretariat would attend as Secretariat support. The Chair asked Cook Islands, FSM, Japan, Korea, RMI, Tokelau, Chinese Taipei and USA to work with the Chair on drafting."
WCPFC12,308,"Japan made a statement indicating its faithful implementation of all the tropical tuna measures; its longline catch of bigeye tuna had decreased from 29,248 mt in 2004 to 14,555 mt in 2014, a reduction of 50%. The number of FAD sets was reduced from 3,162 in 2004 to 1,031 in 2014, a reduction of 67%. Nonetheless Japan observed the total number of FADs used in the entire WCPO increased from 10,768 in 2010 to 16,143 in 2014, an increase of 60%. Hence those CMMs did not achieve the objective of fishing mortality reduction, and instead invited further decline of tropical tuna stocks. Japan described the plight in fishing communities of Japan which rely on the migration of stocks to the area due to this failure of conservation efforts. Japan noted the abundance decline of those stocks was acutely affecting coastal fishing in Japan because it is located in the peripheral part of those stocks. Namely spring skipjack “Hatsugatuo”, which is migrating to the western part of Japan every spring historically famed for notifying the start of spring, but it has disappeared.  The catch of another historically famed fish, bigeye caught in autumn off Sanriku coast has declined drastically. As a result, the coastal skipjack pole and line fishery has had to revert its target to albacore in a substantial part of the year, and the coastal tuna longline fishery had to change its target from bigeye to swordfish and blue shark. Fortunately, the conditions of those alternate stocks happened to be favourable, but the number of coastal fishers decreased from 396 to 287 in the last 10 years. More severe blow hit the artisanal fisheries in the Japanese coastal communities, many of which are experiencing the danger of extinction. In 2008, Japan was looking forward to sufficient conservation benefit from high seas pocket closure, 3 months FAD closure and the Vessel Day scheme for reduction of fishing mortality by purse seiners. But they did not bring about the expected benefit. In CMM 2013-01, Japan again expected the same conservation benefit but the effectiveness of it turned out to be insufficient. The number of FADs used in WCPO is continuously increasing. The longline fishing mortality for bigeye did not increase since 2013 because of the exemption of the CMM. Under these circumstances, Japan came to this meeting with determination to take further sacrifice, if necessary, for its large scale fleet and work out better conservation measures to close loopholes. Japan stated it will continue to work with other CCMs for this purpose."
WCPFC12,309,The Chair thanked Japan for its commitment to keep working on this issue.
WCPFC12,310,"On 8 December, Tuvalu gave an update on WCPFC12-2015-DP06. A third revised version had been posted, and was now a joint FFA/Japan proposal for a TRP for skipjack, thanking Japan for its efforts to finding a drafting solution."
WCPFC12,311,Japan stated that local depletion is a serious issue and the Japanese coastal fishermen were suffering from poor skipjack migration to the Japanese coast and expressed appreciation to FFA members for accommodating Japan’s idea. Japan noted that it showed maximum flexibility in order to prevent deterioration of the stock and requested other CCMs to understand the situation that poor skipjack migration to Japanese coast was a very political issue in Japan.
WCPFC12,312,"Guam made some comments on the proposed TRP for skipjack, a stock which is especially important for SIDS. Guam noted that it does not have a large industrial scale fishery for skipjack, but its WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)45  small scale coastal troll fishery is highly dependent on the stock, forming about 63% of pelagic fish landings, which was also the case for CNMI. Guam noted that its waters are immediately adjacent to the world’s largest purse-seine skipjack tuna fishery, which has seen a year-on-year increase in volume of harvest. Guam’s local fishermen are convinced that both skipjack and yellowfin have become much scarcer as the purse-seine fishery skipjack catch has increased. This CCM noted the concerns expressed by Japan about the scarcity of skipjack in its waters and the possible reduction in local availability of the resource, observing that these same skipjack travel past Guam/CNMI to get to Japan. Guam noted that this has important implications for its food security and fishing culture."
WCPFC12,313,"The CNMI broadly supported the TRP for skipjack, with skipjack the principal commercial fish landed in the CNMI, accounting for over 60% of pelagic fish landings. CNMI noted that it did not have a large scale industrial tuna fishery but relies on coastal troll fishing. It did benefit in the late 1980s from a Guam-based purse-seine operation which had a cold store and transshipment facility on Tinian, and fished to the south of the Mariana Islands. CNMI noted SPC studies that indicate that the US EEZ around the Mariana Archipelago contains a considerable skipjack resource, with an average spawning biomass in excess of 80,000 metric tonnes. It was noted that in the 1930s, Japanese pole and line vessels operating used to catch up to 3,700 metric tonnes, which was over ten times the current combined annual catches from Guam and CNMI. The CNMI has a narrow economic base and sees fisheries as an area that could be expanded, and are interested in implications for their fisheries development in the CNMI from the skipjack TRP and request further evaluation of the spatial impacts to the skipjack resource."
WCPFC12,314,The Commission adopted CMM 2015-06 establishing a TRP for skipjack tuna (Attachment G)
WCPFC12,315,"On 8 December, the Chair gave an update on the HOD+1 discussion which had taken place that morning. These heads of delegation and technical experts met in the spirit of compromise. The Chair noted that there has been an important exchange of views amongst the members that increased understanding of the issues. The Chair noted that while agreement on the draft was not reached, there was willingness to continue having these discussions after the conclusion of WCPFC12. The Chair thanked participants, especially those who had helped with drafting the night before – Cook Islands, FSM, Japan, Korea, RMI, Tokelau, Chinese Taipei and USA. These CCMs were especially constructive in getting text on the table for other members to consider. In light of the outcome on CMM 2014-01, the Chair commented that the Commission needs to take a hard look at the approach the Commission takes to reaching agreement – that is, the consensus approach. At a time when the stakes are getting higher each year, the Chair commented that the Commission needs to examine whether it is conducting discussions in the best way to achieve outcomes. The Chair urged members to take that hard look after this meeting, in order to come back next year in a better position to make progress for the people members are representing when they come here."
WCPFC12,316,A number of participants made statements about the outcomes on the tropical tuna measure.
WCPFC12,317,"PNA members and Tokelau expressed their disappointment with the outcome on their proposed revisions to CMM 2014-01. These members stated that they had been prepared to go beyond the proposals, in response to the advice from SPC. These CCMs noted that the failure to improve measures to conserve and manage tropical tunas, especially bigeye, undermined the sustainable development opportunities of their people. PNA members stated that they will be working through 2016 to implement FAD charging and FAD tracking, the longline VDS, continued strengthening of the purse-seine VDS, and work on harvest strategies. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)46"
WCPFC12,318,"Japan also expressed disappointment in the outcome this year, reiterating its statement from the day earlier about its implementation of the measures and reductions in catch and FAD numbers; the number of FADs used in WCPO is continuously increasing and the longline fishing mortality for bigeye did not decrease since 2013 because of the exemption of the CMM. Japan was disappointed to find the stalemate caused by the crush between the interest of the industrialised fishing fleet of each party and the right of fishing development of SIDS. Japan also stated that it did not enjoy any exemption of the relevant CMM, and continued to faithfully implement the current measure."
WCPFC12,319,"American Samoa stressed that its economy is highly dependent on the tuna fishery, with two high volume canneries that employ over half of the local private sector work force. In addition, American Samoa has 20 locally-based large-scale purse seiners, about 20 local longliners, and support businesses such as the shipyard, net yards, fuel suppliers, maintenance and repair service providers and stevedoring companies. American Samoa benefits from US regulatory and enforcement resources to ensure compliance with Commission decisions. For American Samoa-based purse-seine vessels, the high seas areas close to Pago Pago represent historical fishing grounds which, when they were closed in June this year, saw an immediate negative impact on American Samoa’s economy, with a 45% reduction in purse-seine port calls compared to the previous year. There have been negative impacts from American Samoa’s implementation of the US high seas purse seine limits in CMM 2014-01. This CCM raised this issue in the context of Article 30 of the Convention on the special requirement of developing states and territories and sought understanding on the importance of avoiding adverse impacts of high seas effort limits on them."
WCPFC12,320,"USA thanked the Chair for helping the Commission through these discussions and for bringing together those involved in these fisheries for private discussions. This CCM expressed its disappointment that the Commission did not agree a measure which advanced the Commission’s shared interests in better managing these tropical tunas and highlighted the need to begin planning for the development of a measure in 2016. USA offered its views on what types of information would be useful to the Commission as it takes on the challenge of developing this new measure – for the longline fisheries it is important that the Commission consider spatial management, noting that the burden of conservation should be distributed based on where it will have the greatest impact. This CCM considered that the Commission should consider spatial management approaches for longline fisheries, and direct the scientific services provider to conduct an evaluation, particularly with respect to bigeye tuna stock status, for review by SC12, of a variety of spatial management options. These include, but should not necessarily be limited to: • bigeye tuna catch limits that apply only between 10°S and 10°N, where bigeye tuna exploitation is greatest;  • separate bigeye tuna catch limits in each of the WCPFC stock assessment regions, determined by the estimated proportion of the total stock that is in each region; and • a combination of the two previous options or others as appropriate."
WCPFC12,321,"The USA also offered its views on the types of information that would be useful to support the Commission’s consideration of management approaches for purse-seine fisheries.  It was proposed that the scientific services provider be directed to further investigate individual purse-seine vessel dynamics and operational characteristics with respect to catches of bigeye tuna. It was expected that such investigations would complement the work presented at SC11, which showed that about 10% of all purse seine vessels are responsible for approximately 30% of the total bigeye purse seine catch. The science provider should study what these top bigeye-catching purse seine vessels are doing differently, with the idea that a better understanding could help identify technical or other methods to mitigate bigeye mortality in purse seine fisheries. To support improvement of the tropical tunas measure as a whole, USA also requested that the scientific services provider be directed to prepare, as it has done for past meetings, tables of the expected consequences of various combinations of FAD set limits and longline bigeye catch WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)47  limits. The USA opined that this would help the Commission choose a combination of measures that not only achieves the objective, but does so in a fair manner. The information should include, for each scenario, measures of the relative fishery impact of the two sectors, including how their respective impacts change over time as the bigeye tuna stock rebuilds. USA commented that it was also important to ensure compliance with the measures in place, sharing others’ concerns that the measures are being disparately implemented and the Commission is not seeing the expected actions, such as closing fisheries and bringing enforcement actions. This CCM was looking to ensure measures adopted in the future are effective, and achieving the objectives for which they are were adopted."
WCPFC12,322,"Korea thanked CCMs for their cooperation and efforts but, despite this effort, the Commission had not reached an agreement on a new tropical tuna measure. This CCM noted that since 2013, the longline sector has been subject to catch limits and vessel number restrictions and strengthened MCS, while the purse-seine measure has stayed the same since 2014, and the status quo will continue to 2016. Korea noted that the effectiveness of CMM 2014-01 is subject to review every year but questioned whether the effectiveness can be evaluated when all relevant components have not been fully implemented, and the problem may lie in implementation. Korea noted that FADs greatly impact bigeye, and urged the Commission to strengthen FAD measures to reduce juvenile bigeye mortality, so they can grow into recruitment and spawning stocks, creating a positive feedback loop for stock rebuilding. Korea stated that, to this end, the longline sector was doing its part and complying with hard catch limits. In the SWG, Korea had suggested strengthening MCS on longliners, such as increasing polling rates and flexibility in gradual increase of observer coverage. Korea committed to working with all CCMs to find a constructive solution for tropical tuna management, including FAD-related issues, and hoped that before the next meeting CCMs can identify inherent problems in the current measure and its implementation, and focus on finding solutions based on clear scientific advice."
WCPFC12,323,"PNG thanked the Chair for her work and representations during the SWG, and agreed with Korea that implementation was part of the problem. In response to the USA’s comments, PNG commented that spatial management could be a topic of discussion for the high seas areas, but this will not supersede national laws."
WCPFC12,324,"EU expressed disappointment, seeing the Chair’s draft as a balanced one which would have strengthened management. EU supported the USA’s comments on the importance of particular research that might provide useful information to inform future discussions and options to guide the Commission’s discussions, noting that some of the elements were already available in the work SPC was doing, the harvest strategy workplan, and the research plan through the FADMgmtOptions-IWG. However, EU noted that without political will the Commission will not be able to address the problem."
WCPFC12,325,"Cooks joined the other CCMs in acknowledging the Chair’s work. This CCM stated that its preference would have been to accommodate a zone-based FAD limit, and reiterated its concern about allowing states the choice of FAD measures undermines their sovereign rights to adopt measures beyond those of coastal states."
WCPFC12,326,"The IATTC Executive Secretary Dr Compeán read a statement on behalf of Guillermo Morán, the IATTC Chairman. The IATTC Chairman considered that the time had come to take steps towards establishing joint management strategies for the shared tuna populations. The IATTC Chairman’s letter outlined the most effective management actions adopted to date in IATTC, and asked WCPFC12 to consider a) strengthening scientific cooperation, b) identifying differences in characteristics and structure of purse-seine operation and stock dynamics in the central and western Pacific and eastern Pacific, c) developing management measures such as a total closure of catches for the purse-seine fishery for skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tunas, with the number and timing of days of closure based on the best available science, and d) developing a coordinated rebuilding and management plan for Pacific bluefin WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)48  tuna. On this, IATTC will ask WCPFC for a joint meeting with all interested parties after the 2016 ISC stock assessment, in order to adopt equivalent reference points."
WCPFC12,327,"RMI commended the Chair and Executive Director for their efforts from the outset, starting early in the year. RMI noted that a TRP for skipjack was agreed but on tropical tuna there was a sense of déjà vu from where the Commission left off in Apia. The PNA proposal was not agreed in Apia, on the grounds that members needed more time; this was resubmitted and was not agreed in Bali. RMI asked what the value of SIDS participation in WCPFC was, with their aspirations to develop their economies around the only resource they have. RMI noted that it will go away and do work internally."
WCPFC12,328,"The Organisation for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries (OPRT) was disappointed that WCPFC12 had not come up with effective measures especially a decrease in the catch of bigeye tuna. This observer organization noted that the WCPO bigeye tuna is overfished, and the Commission has received a series of pieces of scientific advice on this issue. For the longline fishery, 6 CCMs with specific annual quotas reduced their bigeye tuna catches in accordance with relevant provisions 2013-01 and 2014-01. However, OPRT looked forward to further effective actions to be taken by the purse-seine fleet."
WCPFC12,329,"The Commission agreed to amend CMM 2014-01 to i) replace references to “2015” with “2016” in paragraphs 25, 28, 29, and 43 and ii) include reference to CMM 2014-01, in paragraph 62, Attachment C para 1 and 9, and Attachment E preamble (Attachment H, CMM 2015-01). AGENDA ITEM 10 – REVIEW OF CMM 2010-05 (SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE)  10.1 General overview of the status of the stock (South Pacific albacore)"
WCPFC12,330,"G. Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented a compendium of fishery indicators for south Pacific albacore tuna, including: total catch; catch by gear; and longline effort and nominal longline CPUE trends, along with their spatial patterns (WCPFC12-2015-14). The status of the south Pacific albacore stock from the most recent (2015) assessment was summarised and the potential stock consequences of recent fishing patterns relative to the agreed biomass limit reference point examined, using stochastic stock projections and incorporating the recommendations on inclusion of uncertainty from SC9. Based upon the 2015 stock assessment, and the level of uncertainty included within the projection analysis, there is a 20% chance that the south Pacific albacore stock will fall below the Limit Reference Point by 2033 under recent fishing effort levels. Overall average decreases in vulnerable biomass (a CPUE proxy) of 14% in longline fisheries were also estimated."
WCPFC12,331,"Chinese Taipei asked about the rationale, noting the condition of the stock is that albacore is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. This CCM also commented that the new stock assessment used different assumptions and the result was very different from the past three assessments. For example, a similar level was suggested for potential depletion of spawning stock biomass which was between 0.58 – 0.68 in the past three assessments but the new assessment using different assumptions suggested 0.4. This CCM expressed the concern of using projections based on this result to derive TRP."
WCPFC12,332,"Pilling explained that in the projections that were run, SPC assumed that future effort would remain constant at the 2013 level; as stock declines over time the catch would reduce. If the assumption was that the catch was constant, Pilling noted that the status of the stock would be even worse. Responding to Chinese Taipei’s question about the assessment for 2015, as agreed by SC, a value of 0.3 for natural mortality was used. This value is consistent with the value used for albacore in other areas of WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)49  the world. Pilling noted there were also high catches for the last five or six years, which would drive the stock to a lower state."
WCPFC12,333,"In response to Japan’s question about the geographical definition of the subtropical and tropical longline fisheries presented in the assessment report, Pilling clarified that using the spatial structure SPC used for this assessment, the region 10°S to 25°S represented the subtropical longline fleet."
WCPFC12,334,"Chinese Taipei asked whether the area showing an increase in catch was south of 20°S or north of 20°S. In response Pilling commented that the pattern of changes in catch was reasonably consistent with the pattern shown in the impact plot, and the increasing impact in the 10°S-25°S latitudinal band was related to increases in catch in this latitudinal region."
WCPFC12,335,"In response to the Cook Island’s query about the relative level of troll and longline fisheries, and how the study modelled their effort from 2013, Pilling noted that when running the status quo model, the stock was projected forward under 2013 levels in both the troll and longline fisheries. In contrast, the analysis presented to HSW on target reference points for south Pacific albacore adjusted levels of effort in the longline fishery only, keeping the troll fishery constant at 2013 levels."
WCPFC12,336,"After this general discussion, the Chair directed further discussions on the topic to be undertaken in the SWG. 10.2 Review of CMM 2010-05 Measure"
WCPFC12,337,"Recommendations from relevant WCPFC subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups were presented to help facilitate a review by the Commission of the Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific albacore (CMM 2010-05). For ease of consultation by the Commission, these recommendations were collated into a reference document (WCPFC12-2015-15).  It was also noted that the context for the recommendations could be found in the full body of each report."
WCPFC12,338,There were no comments on these two committees’ recommendations on South Pacific albacore.
WCPFC12,339,"The Chair noted that, as discussed earlier in the meeting, discussions within the SWG on South Pacific albacore should seek to draw a distinction between strengthening the measure for management purposes and assessing compliance. It was noted that the outcomes from the HSW would be posted when finalised for use in the SWG discussions as needed.  The outcomes from the HSW were discussed under agenda item 12.6 FFA proposal to establish a target reference point for South Pacific albacore"
WCPFC12,340,"FFA presented WCPFC12-2015-DP03_rev1, with three main purposes: set a TRP of 45% of the unfished biomass for south Pacific albacore; provide a reference to the existing LRP agreement; and establish that the acceptable risk of breaching this limit reference point will be 5% or less. FFA noted that it had settled on a TRP after considerable debate, and after due consideration of the alternatives analysed in bioeconomic models and industry views. The proposal aims to address the Commission priority to implement Article 6 of the Convention and establish the “best practice” management principles described in CMM 2014-06, and ensure viable south Pacific albacore fisheries. As these fisheries target only part of the size-range of the stock, they are only commercially viable when the stock biomass is considerably above the biomass that would produce MSY. Fishing the stock down to MSY would reduce longline catch rates below the level where they are profitable. According to the 2015 stock assessment, the stock biomass in 2013 was ~41% of what the biomass would be in the absence of fishing. These CCMs stated that, while moving the biomass indicator from 41% back to 45% does not sound significant, the stock is WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)50  on a downward trajectory and already requires a cut in total longline fishing catch by 37% over the course of a rebuilding program. FFA commented that if fishing efforts remains at current levels there is a 20% probability of breaching the LRP – not the “very low” risk required by Article 6 of the Convention. This proposal was discussed at the HSW where useful feedback was received. These CCMs noted that the text can be modified to reflect that the interim TRP will be the basis for analytical work towards a harvest strategy for the fishery but FFA members were not proposing to lock anything in, nor immediate catch and effort reductions."
WCPFC12,341,"In response to a question from one CCM about how the figures were generated, the FFA Secretariat noted that two detailed presentations were given at the HSW which spoke to the risk levels and demonstrated how 5% sits in relation to the agreed LRP, current stock status and the proposed TRP. A second presentation by FFA was made on the decision-making process used by FFA members to take SPC’s bio-economic assessment and come to the proposal for a 45% TRP."
WCPFC12,342,The Chair noted that discussions on the details could continue in the SWG.  FFA proposal to revise CMM 2010-05 to address the advice of SC11 and TCC11
WCPFC12,343,"Introducing WCPFC12-2015-DP04_rev1, FFA members noted that over the last decade they had made attempts to improve CMM 2010-05 to address the advice from their fishermen and SC10 and SC11 that longline fishing mortality and catch need to be reduced to avoid further decline in the vulnerable biomass so that economically viable catch rates can be maintained. The new stock assessment and increased catch over the past five years increases the urgency of those concerns; active management is needed and FFA commented that CMM 2010-05 is not capable of doing that job. Until a more effective measure is developed, the FFA proposal aims to help CMM 2010-05 fulfil its purpose which is ensure vessel numbers in this fishery do not increase above 2000-2004 or 2005 levels south of 20°S, noting that TCC has advised that the CMM in its current form is not capable of doing that. DP04 inserts data requirements into the CMM, providing two alternatives for decision by WCPFC – a) to expand the provision of summary data by CCMs for their vessels that take albacore south of 20°S or b) for those CCMs that do not already provide operational data to enter into or extend an agreement with SPC to make operational data available for the purposes of this CMM. Both make data available for annual analysis by the Secretariat that would enable the Commission to effectively assess the performance of the measure against its baselines. DP04 also inserts a new definition (“vessels actively fishing for south Pacific albacore”). FFA has consulted on this definition and the proposal was revised: FFA proposed that an actively fishing vessel be defined as a vessel which catches more than 5 tonnes of south Pacific albacore in a calendar year. These CCMs have kept amendments to a minimum as its aim is to address the TCC advice, not fix albacore management; they look to the harvest strategy process and the Tokelau Arrangement to do that. Lastly these CCMs noted that if CMM 2010-05 cannot be fixed it cannot be assessed and does not do anything."
WCPFC12,344,"New Caledonia spoke in support of the adoption of a TRP for South Pacific albacore, commenting that most of the waters below 20°S are on the high seas where there is poor observer coverage, weak enforcement and a lack of operational data from major longline fleets fishing there. This CCM comment that albacore mostly spawns between the equator and 20°S and there is more or less free access to this stock. While it is not overfished the uncertainty around it is high and the spawning biomass has been declining for years. This CCM looks to the Tokelau Arrangement, under which FFA members limit the catch of South Pacific albacore in their waters. New Caledonia has capped the number of vessels authorized to fish in its EEZ to 21 since 2011, all New Caledonia-owned longliners, with no licenses issued to foreign vessels for 15 years. New Caledonia’s fishing companies voluntarily adhere to a certification process based largely on compliance with domestic and international regulations. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)51"
WCPFC12,345,"The Chair noted that the SWG led by Australia to look at the South Pacific albacore CMM would cover the TRP proposal, the proposal to strengthen the existing measure and the element of the harvest strategy work plan covering albacore. The Chair urged delegates to keep in mind the TCC recommendations relating to the sub-committee’s inability to assess the measure’s performance and compliance against it.  Outcomes of south Pacific albacore CMM 2010-05 SWG discussions"
WCPFC12,346,"On 5 December Australia reported that the SWG had begun discussions on DP03, DP04 and the South Pacific albacore components of the harvest strategy work plan DP09. There was no consensus on a TRP (DP03), nor was there consensus on an acceptable level of risk for the LRP; this would require revisions to the albacore components of the harvest strategy work plan. There was general agreement on a preamble for DP04 but currently no consensus on the definition of ‘actively fishing’, however there were positive comments about supplying data."
WCPFC12,347,"Prior to the SWG meeting on 7 December, the Cook Islands made a statement in plenary, borne out of concern that polarised positions were emerging around critical measures and noting that it was time for individual states to step up. The Cooks Islands supported WCPFC adopting a meaningful harvest strategy as per the FFA Sustainable Fisheries Roadmap. This CCM’s intervention came with the support of the Cook Islands Prime Minister and recognised that the albacore longline fishery is an area in which the Cook Islands had individual influence. The Cook Islands was willing to offer a concession. In 2012 the Cook Islands accounted for 10,700 tonnes of albacore tuna, 15% of the total WCPFC catches. Its commitment to the FFA Tokelau Agreement was to reduce its catch to 9,600 tonnes. In light of the SC recommendation to reduce catches by 37% this CCM offered to work within the WCPFC harvest strategy to reduce catches further than that, to 35%, or a reduction of 4,000 tonnes, to 7,000 tonnes within two years. This concession to reduce catch was conditional on a phased reduction and eventual ban of longline fishing in the Eastern High Seas Pocket, noting that it would be prejudicial to the Cook Islands’ interests and FFA domestic fleets and coastal states’ fleets if the Cook Islands reduced catches in its zone while effort was to increase in the Eastern High Seas Pocket. The Cook Islands challenged members to work within the CMMs but also engage in open dialogue and apply commitments across the board, offering meaningful concessions at WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,348,"Australia reported that SWG met three times this week, with substantial participation and constructive engagement. However, no agreement was reached on an albacore TRP or the acceptable levels of risk of breaching the reference point. The SWG had some success on the data provision proposal. The proposal required submission of species catch data, by vessel, by year for 2006-2014 and earlier years where possible. The proposal was not to require vessel names to retain confidentiality; vessels would be identified as ‘Vessel 1’, ‘Vessel 2’, etcetera."
WCPFC12,349,"There were two small issues on the draft which were resolved in plenary – USA wanted to restore some language around the number and catch of albacore from all vessels which had been deleted in the draft, and China asked for the deletion of ‘average’ from para. 1."
WCPFC12,350,"The Commission adopted CMM 2015-02 which will revise and replace CMM 2010-05 (Attachment I, CMM 2015-02)."
WCPFC12,351,Australia further reported that there was no consensus on establishing a TRP for albacore.
WCPFC12,352,"American Samoa expressed frustration at the lack of progress to strengthen the conservation and management of South Pacific albacore, on which American Samoa’s longline fishery is almost entirely WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)52  dependent. This CCM’s domestic longline fishery had gone through great changes in the last ten years, going from feast to famine, noting that ten years ago, the fishery was in good shape but recently, the economics of the fishery became so poor that operators had to tie up. In the same time period American Samoa has lost its small scale albacore fishery, and this CCM recognised that its South Pacific neighbours have experienced similar downturns in their fisheries. American Samoa supported Commission measures that improve economic and resource conditions for the South Pacific longline fleets, and expressed concerns about the potential impact of on the supply of albacore to our local canneries in American Samoa of measures which had been proposed. American Samoa’s tuna industry preceded the Commission’s existence by many decades, and our economy is completely dependent on tuna processing. This CCM supported continued efforts to identify an albacore TRP through the harvest strategy process that leads to improved catch rates while minimizing impacts on the local processing facilities of SIDS and Participating Territories."
WCPFC12,353,"FFA members registered their disappointment that WCPFC12 did not secure a TRP for the albacore fishery. An albacore TRP was discussed at the last two MOWs and the HSW prior to WCPFC12. These CCMs advised CCMs that if they expect consensus or compromise, a credible proposal has to be provided. FFA members stated that South Pacific coastal states will continue to develop collaborative zone-based management arrangements and while they preferred to develop them within overall limits of a Commission-wide TRP, in its absence these CCMs will finalise the establishment of their own management system for fisheries within their EEZs, including the use of an interim TRP. It was noted that three-quarters of the albacore catch is taken within EEZs."
WCPFC12,354,The Cook Islands reiterated that it was prepared to make significant cuts but with a commensurate reduction in effort in adjacent areas. CCMs could consider including in their vessel licencing conditions measures on the high seas that can accompany the Cook Islands cuts.
WCPFC12,355,"New Zealand supported the Cook Islands and FFA statements, noting that a TRP was a priority for New Zealand this year. Over the next year, this CCM wanted other members to become more engaged, especially with the analysis done by SPC, which clearly illustrates that current catch levels are not sustainable. AGENDA ITEM 11 – BYCATCH MITIGATION (SHARKS, SEABIRDS, TURTLES,  WHALE SHARKS, CETACEANS)"
WCPFC12,356,Recommendations from relevant subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups were considered by the Commission to facilitate the review of the selected bycatch mitigation CMMs with the objective of refining and improving their effectiveness. The Commission reviewed three specific CMMs and three proposals under this agenda item. It was noted that there no stock status overviews for the bycatch stocks concerned. The SC and TCC recommendations were contained in WCPFC12-2015-16 for easy reference.
WCPFC12,357,The Chair asked CCMs if there were any issues with the SC11 and TCC11 recommendations on any of the shark species (WCPFC12-2015-16). No general comments or concerns were raised. 11.1 CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05 (Sharks)
WCPFC12,358,The Commission reviewed the two Conservation and Management Measures for sharks (CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)53  EU proposal for Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks
WCPFC12,359,"With WCPFC12-2015-DP16, EU introduced it proposal to amend CMM 2010-07, to implement a ‘fins attached’ policy. EU commented that this year was the first time the Commission had received two strong recommendations from both sub-committees and noted in particular that SC11 had discussed the issue extensively and had reviewed research and data provided by one CCM which was implementing the fin-to-carcass ratio – research which demonstrated that despite the best efforts and goodwill of this CCM to perform this analysis as scientifically as possible several important shortcomings have been identified. SC11 had made a clear recommendation (SC11 Summary Report para. 553) following this review. EU noted that TCC11 had also made a strong recommendation (TCC11 Summary Report para. 462) relating to the inability to assess compliance with the enforcement of the fin-to-carcass weight ratio as means for implementing the finning ban in the WCPFC CA. This CCM stated that the subsidiary bodies of the Commission had made these recommendations and they cannot be ignored, particularly when the Commission receives observer reports that demonstrate that finning is still occurring. The EU offered to discuss the proposal with interested parties in the margins."
WCPFC12,360,"EU also took the opportunity to speak to CMM 2014-05, noting that the CMM which was adopted last year included shark management plans. While this was considered progress towards the management of sharks, SC11 had looked at the submitted management plans and raised concerns that there were not clear guidelines about what elements these plans should include and had asked the Commission for guidance on how to build these plans. EU expressed the view that WCPFC12 needed to give this guidance to the SC and TCC so they are able to do their work and have effective management plans in place. The EU also hoped to discuss this issue with interested parties."
WCPFC12,361,"FFA members supported the intention of the EU proposal to strengthen existing CMMs for sharks, ensure full utilisation of sharks that are landed and contribute to decreased mortality. FFA members tabled a comprehensive revision to the shark measure at WCPFC11 which included a prohibition on finning, with a narrowly defined exception. These members would discuss this further with the EU. FFA members hoped to see a consolidation of existing shark CMMs, particularly CMM2010-07 and 2014-05, and took the view that the EU proposal would be best incorporated into the main shark measure rather than be a stand-alone measure."
WCPFC12,362,The Chair noted that the Commission has five shark-related CMMs and asked that WCPFC12 consider consolidating them so that they become a little more user-friendly and easier to access.
WCPFC12,363,"Fiji noted that shark fins ratio were discussed at length at SC, which had come to the view that data on fin-to-carcass ratios was not available and came up with a Shark Research Plan for directed research which also includes further Monte Carlo simulation work."
WCPFC12,364,"USA expressed strong support for the EU proposal and supported the idea to combine the measures, making them more user-friendly and coherent. The USA would be happy to engage in this work. NC had made a recommendation to both SC and ISC that they work together to determine whether North Pacific blue shark is a northern stock. The SC had simply noted that the ISC had provided information, but SC had not taken action. The USA considered it important for the SC to commit to doing that work, and to that end wanted the Commission to convey to the SC the importance of making a recommendation on this stock. In the view of this delegation it was in the purview of the NC, and North Pacific blue shark was a stock that needs to be managed. USA wanted the record to reflect a decision to instruct the SC to move that forward. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)54"
WCPFC12,365,"Japan followed up the USA comment on blue shark, noting that on 4 December 2015 the NC would meet and would hopefully adopt the recommendation in the NC meeting report.  This matter was discussed under Agenda 12.2."
WCPFC12,366,"SPREP endorsed EU’s views on shark bycatch and welcomed the trend towards increasing collaboration with other organisations to address bycatch issues. This is exemplified in the ABNJ project work which Dr Shelley Clarke was leading. SPREP noted that it is not primarily a research agency, but it is engaged in advocacy initiatives regarding sharks, especially through the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, and extend to other threatened and migratory species. SPREP commented that by-catch is clearly a significant problem affecting many threatened and migratory species, and welcomed the opportunity to discuss these issues with the Secretariat and others during WCPFC12, and collaborate with fellow CROP agencies, FFA and SPC, to make a substantive contribution to the mitigation of turtle bycatch."
WCPFC12,367," Japan noted that WCPFC11 had adopted a measure which requires the development of a management plan for longline fisheries that target sharks; Japan and Chinese Taipei had developed management plans and submitted them to SC11. Japan stated that to develop the plan the government had held meetings with fresh longline fleet fishermen based at Kesennuma fishing port many times and that the plan included the requirement for fins to be naturally attached, a catch limit and restrictions on catching small-sized sharks. Japan took the view that it was an appropriate plan for the conservation and management of sharks and would be implemented from 2016."
WCPFC12,368,A number of CCMs noted that SC had clearly asked for guidance on the management plans.
WCPFC12,369,The Chair noted that there were two clear recommendations from SC and TCC which confirm that these subcommittees had not been able to progress CMM 2014-05 in any real way. SC had found it difficult to evaluate these plans and TCC had concurred; the Commission needed to develop the guidelines required. It was noted that there was not a set of minimum guidelines drafted. The Chair suggested either creating a small group to do that drafting during WCPFC12 or work through the sub-committees to provide those guidelines for the Commission to adopt in 2016.
WCPFC12,370,"EU wanted a clear recommendation from WCPFC12 on this matter. It was noted that Dr Shelley Clarke, who was currently attached to the Commission, was an expert in sharks and bycatch and suggested she could start preparing an ideal management plan document which could be discussed and revised as appropriate at SC12 and TCC12 for adoption and future implementation by CCMs."
WCPFC12,371,A number of CCMs suggested that the Secretariat develop the initial draft to go to SC and TCC.
WCPFC12,372,USA commented that it would be useful to discuss this in a small working group to develop some instructions for the Secretariat.
WCPFC12,373,Japan supported the idea of developing a draft guideline to evaluate a management plan for future review but stressed that it was implementing its management plan from 2016 in order to contribute to management of sharks.
WCPFC12,374,"The Chair noted the consensus for a small group to meet and develop a recommendation that sets out what the Commission would be tasking the Secretariat to produce for SC and TCC, to bring back to WCPFC13. EU would lead that small group, with work on CMM 2010-07 continuing in the margins of WCPFC12. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)55"
WCPFC12,375,"On 5 December, EU reported that the informal group discussing shark issues had met on 4 December. EU had received comments on its proposal to implement a fins naturally attached policy in CMM 2010-07. EU reported that there was an attempt to try and consolidate CMM 2010-07 with CMM 2014-05 but it had not proved possible at this time. The informal group also discussed the development of guidelines for CCMs that target sharks in association with WCPFC fisheries and are required to develop a management plan for that fishery. A document had been drafted and distributed to delegates. Later on 5 December, EU noted that a revised version of the fins naturally attached amendment had been posted and the group would meet again on 7 December."
WCPFC12,376,"On 8 December, EU updated the Commission on those discussions, noting that it had received comments on the draft and the necessary support for proposal had not been received. It was noted that this was not the first year the EU had introduced a fins naturally attached proposal, and recalled that the 5% fin-to-carcass ratio has been recognised by TCC and SC as impossible to monitor. EU suggested text for a recommendation, noting that it was not EU’s preferred option but was a way forward, to recognise the impasse and conclusions reached by TCC and SC and help the Commission move forward and prepare the debate for next year, to provide an effective measure which can be monitored and controlled and which serves its purpose."
WCPFC12,377,A lengthy discussion took place on the draft text.
WCPFC12,378,"USA expressed appreciation for the efforts of the EU in trying to deal with this issue, and noted that the fins naturally attached provisions were supported by many around the table. However, this CCM had concerns with paras. 1 and 2."
WCPFC12,379,EU noted that it had encouraged comments from delegations during the meeting and there was consensus on the language at the informal group.
WCPFC12,380,"Japan, China and Indonesia had queries about the format, and whether it was meant to be a CMM or a recommendation, and on some of the language used."
WCPFC12,381,"WWF, Shark Advocates International, Humane Society International, Greenpeace, International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, MDPI, Earth Island Institute, Conservation International, The Pew Charitable Trusts, International Pole and Line Foundation, and Birdlife International expressed their support for the development of guidelines to improve management plans for targeted shark fisheries to ensuring that existing measures are enforceable, and that the waste and risk associated with shark finning is eliminated. These observer organisations opined that the only way to guarantee that sharks have not been finned is to require that carcasses be landed with the fins naturally attached. It was noted that the Marine Stewardship Council considers fins naturally attached as the only compliance standard that can provide certainty, and prohibiting at-sea shark fin removal can facilitate improved data on shark catches. It was noted that the fins naturally attached approach is mandated in a growing number of countries and is gaining acceptance in international arenas, referencing a similar proposal was co-sponsored by 30 ICCAT parties recently. These organisations expressed frustration that WCPFC has not adopted this best practice for preventing shark finning, and reiterated their request that such action is taken as soon as possible."
WCPFC12,382,Fiji reminded CCMs the shark research plan adopted during the last SC still stands.
WCPFC12,383,"EU expressed its disappointment that the proposal had not been accepted, noting that only one part of the language was additional beyond what TCC already noted. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)56"
WCPFC12,384,"On 8 December, EU reported back to plenary on its proposal to provide guidance for the elaboration and evaluation of management plans for target shark fisheries (WCPFC12-2015-DP26). A revision had been posted, and EU noted the very constructive work which had taken place at the informal group. It was noted that the rationale was to give guidance for the development of management plans that are foreseen in CMM 2014-05, and the guidance is based on that rationale. According to the draft terms of reference for the development of guidelines, management plans should be based on Article 5 of the Convention and para. 2 of CMM 2014-05, taking into account advice from SC and TCC. The Secretariat is directed to propose a range of possible definitions of a longline fishery targeting key shark species in association with WCPFC fisheries, for the consideration of SC12 and TCC12. EU noted that this was not a CMM, just guidance for a process to be undertaken in 2016."
WCPFC12,385,"Australia supported the text, and noted that it was supported by consensus in the informal group."
WCPFC12,386,"Japan suggested that “shall” be amended to “should”, reflecting that they are guidelines. Japan noted that, with this amendment, it will go along with the guidelines to be used when developing its next management plan in the future."
WCPFC12,387,China and Chinese Taipei supported the draft guidelines with the amendment proposed by Japan.
WCPFC12,388,The Commission tasks the Secretariat to develop a paper that provides guidance on the development and evaluation of management plans for longline fisheries targeting sharks in association with WCPFC fisheries (CMM 2014-05) and which takes into account the elements and timeframes contained in Attachment J). 11.2 CMM 2012-04 (Whale Sharks)
WCPFC12,389,The Commission discussed the Conservation and Management Measure on the protection of whale sharks from purse-seine operations (CMM 2012-04) and guidelines which had been developed for the safe release of encircled animals.
WCPFC12,390,It was noted that the guidelines were finalised at SC11 and put forward for TCC’s consideration and for the Commission for adoption. Many CCMs expressed support for the adoption of the guidelines.
WCPFC12,391,"FFA members noted that there was nothing in place for the safe release of whale sharks, and commented that the guidelines can be updated as new research on their practical application becomes available. These CCMs’ support recognised that application of the guidelines was non-binding and did not supersede the specific national laws that some CCMs have in place on this matter. In addition, FFA members endorsed TCC11 recommendations on the ongoing development by SC of more comprehensive guidelines pertaining to the safe release of sharks and rays, and other animals important to coastal States."
WCPFC12,392,"USA suggested that the Commission also consider transitioning some of the guidelines to enforceable requirements, based on additional research confirming the guidelines are the appropriate way to safely release whale sharks. This CCM suggested that something be put in place to ensure the necessary research is undertaken to determine if the guidelines are the best methods for the Commission to then convert into measures and requirements."
WCPFC12,393,"EU suggested that research could continue and new, better methods could be found but until then the guidelines could be adopted as minimum standards."
WCPFC12,394,WCPFC12 endorsed the “Guidelines for Safe Release of Encircled Animals including whale WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)57  sharks” as recommended by SC11 and TCC11 as contained in Attachment K. 11.3 CMM 2012-07 (Seabirds) Japan proposal to revise CMM 2012-07 to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish stocks on seabirds
WCPFC12,395,"Japan introduced a proposal for seabird mitigation (WCPFC12-2015-DP02a/WCPFC12-2015-DP02b) which would require small scale vessels (less than 24 metres in length) conducting longline fishing activities in the area north of 23°N in the WCPFC area to employ a seabird mitigation measure. Japan noted that in the past three years it had undertaken research on mitigation measure for small scale longline vessels operating in this area and the proposal was based on that research. Those vessels would be required to use at least one seabird mitigation measures in the area north of 23°N. In addition, a specification for a short streamer to be used for small scale fishing vessels was introduced. Japan stressed the importance of fishermen’s safety on board the small scale fishing vessels, and noted that small scale Japanese longline fishing vessels are thinner in shape than other members’ vessels, giving them different vulnerabilities, specifically when using streamers."
WCPFC12,396,Chinese Taipei noted that a number of its flagged small scale vessels fish in this area of the WCPO and supported the proposal as a first step to moving forward.
WCPFC12,397,USA considered the proposal an important step towards eliminating the exemption for small vessels in the North Pacific. This CCM had considered the results of the research Japan had presented to SC11 and remained concerned that there was insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Japan’s proposed tori line design. This CCM would like some work to be done comparing the proposed design with mitigation required for other vessels to generate more substantive evidence that it is effective before its adoption by the Commission.
WCPFC12,398,Australia echoed USA’s comments and asked Japan to elaborate on the scientific evidence that demonstrates adequate mitigation from the use of only one mitigation measure from the entire Table 1 of CMM 2012-07.
WCPFC12,399,"ACAP welcomed Japan’s research on seabird bycatch mitigation in the North Pacific, and noted that this research shows conclusively that there is a high seabird attack rate on small scale longline vessels in the North Pacific, with 70 attacks per 1000 hooks when no mitigation was used and the number of birds caught extremely high. ACAP commented that this demonstrates the importance of using mitigation measures in this area. ACAP requested that this research be presented to the next meeting of the ACAP Seabird Bycatch Working Group so the effectiveness of the proposed tori line design can be evaluated for possible inclusion in ACAP's Best Practice Advice. Regarding the proposed amendment to CCM 2012-07, providing that small vessels in the North Pacific use one of the mitigation measures in Table 1, ACAP noted that only those mitigation measures in column A of Table 1 had been shown conclusively to be effective in reducing seabird bycatch. While ACAP’s best practice advice is that all three measures in Column A should be used in combination, choosing just one measure from Column A of table one would still reduce the number of seabirds caught. ACAP recommended that the Japanese proposal be amended to require the choice of one measure from Column A, rather than one measure from Table 1."
WCPFC12,400,Japan noted that its scientific data was presented to past SC meetings and stressed that the proposal is its best effort at this stage. This CCM stated that it did not want the excuse of not having enough evidence to delay introducing measures. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)58
WCPFC12,401,The Chair noted that the Commission needed to work in the margins on the proposal and asked interested parties to work with Japan before bringing it back to plenary.
WCPFC12,402,"Japan reported back on discussions on its proposal (WCPFC12-2015-DP02). Japan advised that it had met with other members and NGOs and a revised version had been posted. The important change was that previously fishers could choose at least a mitigation method from Column A or B, but in the revised version, only those methods in Column A are available for small scale fishing vessels while number of method required to implement is the same. Japan received comments on the short streamer specifications. Japan noted the difficulties for small scale longline vessels employing a short streamer as specified in CMM 2012-07 because trial implementation of that method on a small longline vessel in the North Pacific ocean caused entanglement of fishing gear during line setting and that safety issues were something on which they could not compromise, and hoped the revised version could be adopted. Japan advised that the similar research as the last three years will continue and the results will be reported to SC. There may be a possibility to review the proposed measure in the future, based on the outcome of the future research."
WCPFC12,403,"USA continued to have concerns about the efficacy of the proposed tori line design, noting Japan’s continued intent to study it, and wanted to put a time constraint in place. USA wanted to provide an opportunity for the efficacy to be evaluated, after which the Commission could make a decision on whether to extend the use of the alternative tori lines. USA noted that the SC had concerns about whether the research supported the claim that it was as efficacious as other measures."
WCPFC12,404,"Japan and USA agreed to talk in the margins about how long the period should be before the measure was reviewed, whether two or three years from the effective date. Japan noted it was conducting the research every year and a two-year timeframe only gave one year of result. On 8 December, Japan and USA advised that they had agreed on language."
WCPFC12,405,"The Commission adopted CMM 2015-03 which will revise and replace CMM 2012-07 (Attachment L, CMM 2015-03). FFA proposal to revise CMM 2012-07 (seabirds)"
WCPFC12,406,"FFA members presented WCPFC12-2015-DP11, to amend CMM 2012-07. The proposal included minor amendments that seek to shift the latitudinal line from 30°S to 25°S, excluding EEZs other than Australia and New Zealand that extend south of 25°S. Referring to SC papers including the latest, SC11-EB-WP-09, FFA members noted the increasing rate of seabird interactions in areas north of 30°S in the Commission area over the years. It was noted that the SC11 meeting record made reference to the ongoing problem of relatively low observer coverage and missing logsheets for longline vessels. For FFA members, this suggests that seabird interactions have not been properly documented and are therefore probably higher than currently reported."
WCPFC12,407,"China noted after the presentation that it had some queries on the proposal: firstly the amendment text did not relate to the preamble, and asked New Zealand to update that section and highlight the rationale behind the change in area. This CCM noted that it could not accept the exclusion of the southern countries’ EEZ from the operation of the measure."
WCPFC12,408,"USA supported the idea of moving the line further north but expressed concerns about the differential treatment of EEZs and the high seas, a distinction that may not be supported scientifically. This CCM suggested further discussions about the FFA proposal, and suggested a slight move of the line could treat EEZs and high seas comparably and also protect seabirds.

WCPFC12,409,"Chinese Taipei expressed similar sentiments, and questioned the exception for vessels operating in the EEZs, noting that seabird mortality often happens close to land. This CCM asked for a scientific comment to address that query."
WCPFC12,410,"Fiji supports the FFA proposal introduced by New Zealand. Some of the seabirds interacting with longliners are endemic to some FFA members like one petrel species in Fiji. Therefore FFA members would want to see reduction in the risk to seabird bycatch by longliners in the overlap area between 30° S and 25° S, but excluding those Pacific Island EEZs that extended south of 25°S."
WCPFC12,411,The Chair suggested that the proponents address these questions or take them up in sideline discussions.
WCPFC12,412,"BirdLife welcomed the proposals put forward by FFA for the South Pacific and Japan for the north Pacific for improving the seabird bycatch measure. BirdLife noted that it has been working for two years to impress upon the Commission the risk posed to albatrosses from small vessels in the north Pacific and, more recently, the risk to vulnerable seabirds breeding in New Zealand such as black petrel and Antipodean albatross in the area between 25°-30°S which is not currently protected by seabird mitigation. This observer organization hoped to work cooperatively with FFA and Japan and other CCMs during WCPFC12 to bring an effective seabird measure to the Commission for endorsement."
WCPFC12,413, New Zealand advised that it would engage with other parties to address some of the issues raised during these discussions.
WCPFC12,414,"On 8 December, New Zealand advised that, following comments across the floor after its introduction, it had initiated meetings with other CCMs. These discussions reinforced that the exemptions which was the primary concern were quite significant for the member countries. New Zealand noted that exemptions applied in other areas in the context of seabirds, and advised that the proposal is not amended from what was initially proposed."
WCPFC12,415,China noted its difficulties with the initial proposal.
WCPFC12,416,The Chair noted that there was no consensus for adoption of the amendments.
WCPFC12,417,Birdlife hoped that the practical difficulties could be resolved over the coming year and that the proposal could be adopt at WCPFC13. 11.4  Others
WCPFC12,418,"No discussions took place under this agenda item.  AGENDA ITEM 12 – ADOPTION OF REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES, INTERSESSIONAL WORKING GROUPS AND OTHER WORKSHOPS"
WCPFC12,419,"Recommendations of WCPFC subsidiary bodies, intersessional working groups and workshops which were not discussed in earlier agenda items were presented under this agenda item as well as discussions on proposals which had not been discussed in any depth under other agenda items. The Chair noted that the species-specific recommendations were taken as accepted by the Commission.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)60  12.1 SC11"
WCPFC12,420,"On behalf of the SC Chair, A. Batibasaga (Fiji) presented key recommendations, other than species-related recommendations, of the 11th Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (WCPFC12-2015-17a and WCPFC12-2015-17b) held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, from 5- 13 August 2015,chaired by L. Kumoru (PNG). Among the SC recommendations in the SC11 Summary Report, A. Batibasaga asked for the Commission’s specific endorsement of those recommendations in his report as listed below.  SC11 Summary report 172. SC11 recommends that funding be continued to maintain the Project 35: Bigeye Biology and WCPFC Tuna Tissue Bank, with particular emphasis on WCPO bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack tunas. SC11 also recommends that the Commission adopt the “WCPFC Tissue Bank Access Protocols” developed within Project 35 and modified by ISG-2 at SC11 (Attachment D)."
WCPFC12,421,"The presentation of the SC11 recommendation in paragraph 172 (Progress on Project 35) led to extensive procedural discussions. Because the budget had not been finalised as the FAC was still meeting in the margins of WCPFC12, a number of CCMs had concerns about accepting SC recommendations with budgetary implications, including CCMs which said it would be difficult for them to increase their contributions. It was generally agreed that recommendations with financial implications, if supported, are provisionally accepted.  In relation to SC11 recommendation paragraph 172, final approval on Project 35 recommendations would be subject to FAC’s final recommendations on the 2016 budget. SC11 Summary Report 612. SC11 adopts the Shark Research Plan and Stock Assessment Schedule (Attachment H) and recommends that WCPFC12 endorses it."
WCPFC12,422,"Regarding the SC11 decision on the stock assessment schedule in paragraph 612, there were also concerns from one CCM about the timing of stock assessments in the SC work plan, especially related with the skipjack assessment scheduled in 2016. A number of CCMs noted that the reasons for 2016 being chosen to do this assessment included the diminishing value of tuna tagging data, collection of which ended in 2013, and the fact that conducting three tuna stock assessments in one year presented an enormous workload burden for SPC."
WCPFC12,423,"WCPFC12 did not adopt the SC11 report during initial discussions on this agenda item, as a number of issues were not yet resolved. This included the timing of the stock assessments as had been recommended by SC11, and the prioritisation of those assessments, and budget approval for the projects recommended in the SC11 report. The Chair directed those with competing priorities for the timing of the stock assessments to consult in the margins and work out an appropriate schedule to enable the adoption of the SC11 summary report later in the meeting."
WCPFC12,424,"On 8 December, the discussions on this matter resumed."
WCPFC12,425,"Australia noted that skipjack, South Pacific blue shark and thresher shark were on the current schedule of assessments for 2016, and recalled that there was agreement in the informal meeting that the skipjack should be retained but there was an issue with the blue shark assessment: if this was 2017 rather than 2016, data from the EPO could be incorporated. Australia expressed the view that this would be a more efficient use of WCPFC resources and would result in a more comprehensive assessment, however the issue was not a major one for Australia and this CCM would not block consensus."
WCPFC12,426,"EU considered it important to maintain the stock assessment of South Pacific blue shark in 2016, noting the EU could facilitate contacts to obtain EPO information. EU reiterated that it would have preferred to postpone the 2016 skipjack stock assessment. With other CCMs proposing to defer the blue WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)61  shark stock assessment, EU suggested that a compromise would be to not change the assessment schedule recommended by SC11, but adopt it."
WCPFC12,427,"USA concurred with Australia’s comments, noting that in 2016 it will be a data poor fishery without the CPUE data. If it were postponed, the EPO and ABNJ information could be incorporated. The analysis would be more rigorous and more cost effective."
WCPFC12,428,"New Zealand echoed these views, noting the increased data in 2017. However, it noted as a matter of principle that the Commission should adopt the schedule of stock assessments coming out of SC and conduct the skipjack assessment and the blue shark assessment in 2016."
WCPFC12,429,"The Commission endorsed the SC11 recommended stock assessment schedule (Attachment M).  SC11 Summary Report paragraph 386.  SC11 recommends that the Secretariat develops a proposal to establish a formal process and its cost implication to independently review stock assessments. This proposal will be presented to SC12. SC11 Summary Report paragraph 390. Noting that SC10 had considered levels of risk associated with breaching the LRP within the range 5-20%, that the identification of acceptable risk is a management issue, SC11 reaffirmed the recommendation made by SC10 that WCPFC12 identify the level of acceptable risk which should be applied to breaching a LRP for the key target species, noting that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement states that the risk of exceeding LRPs should be very low."
WCPFC12,430,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to develop a proposal, including an indicative budget, to establish a formal process to independently review stock assessments. This proposal will be presented to SC12."
WCPFC12,431,The Commission noted that SC10 had considered levels of risk associated with breaching the LRP within the range 5-20% and that the identification of acceptable risk is a management issue.
WCPFC12,432,"The Commission agreed to identify the level of acceptable risk which should be applied to breaching a LRP for the key target species, noting that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement states that the risk of exceeding LRPs should be very low."
WCPFC12,433,It was noted that discussions on the levels of risk were ongoing within the harvest strategy discussions taking place in the margins of WCPFC12.
WCPFC12,434,"It was agreed that the recommendation relating to the nomination of a SC Vice-Chair (SC11 Summary Report para. 699-700) would be endorsed under agenda item 17.3. Operational level data agreement to support WCPFC stock  SC11 Summary Report paragraph 225. After the discussion among the involved CCMs, it was reported that the CCMs needed domestic clearance before finally agreeing to a new arrangement. However, as a way of cooperation in response to the SC’s appreciation and request, those CCMs agreed not to require SPC to delete their operational data provided to SPC and the products thereof under the condition that they will not be used in any way until a new agreement is reached with SPC. Those CCMs will discuss the new arrangement intersessionally with SPC based on the draft text for WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)62  the Agreement for Provision of Operational-level Data to SPC to Support WCPFC Stock Assessments shown in Attachment E, with the intention of finalizing the arrangement prior to WCPFC12.  SC11 Summary Report paragraph 226. SC11 appreciated the cooperation and flexibility shown by those CCMs involved and expressed its hope that the new arrangement will be agreed among relevant CCMs promptly so that the SPC’s work can be maintained."
WCPFC12,435,"Regarding the new arrangement for the submission of operational level data in paragraph 226 of the SC11 summary report, SPC gave a progress report. J. Hampton noted that at the close of SC11 an agreement had been drafted on the continued submission and retention of operational data to be used in SPC stock assessments undertaken for WCPFC. The CCMs involved in that agreement (China, Japan, Korea, Japan, Chinese Taipei and USA) were going to revert to Capitals to check and come back with advice on whether the agreement was acceptable to those CCMs. Hampton noted that the draft was acceptable to the USA and Chinese Taipei but the other CCMs had not yet provided SPC with advice and hoped they would do so by the end of the meeting. If the agreement was acceptable to these CCMs, the data were due to be updated next year, to be provided by 30 April 2016."
WCPFC12,436,PNG noted the significance for FFA members of the provision of operational data from these states. This CCM asked whether the agreement covered historical data provided for the last assessment and asked for a status update from the CCMs which had not responded to SPC.
WCPFC12,437,"Hampton responded that the data had supported the Pacific-wide bigeye analysis undertaken in 2015. He also noted that full historical data to the extent that the data have been collected by fishing states concerned were provided to SPC for that analysis and had also been integrated into the data set. The integrated data set is very large and comprehensive, and of considerable value to ongoing stock assessment work."
WCPFC12,438,USA confirmed that it has agreed to provide the data.
WCPFC12,439,"On 8 December, SPC sought clarification on whether the draft data agreement which had come out of SC11 was acceptable to the relevant parties."
WCPFC12,440,Japan noted that the remaining issue was consistency with existing rules and measures. This CCM noted that there are already the scientific data rules and the CMM (CMM 2014-01). Japan asked for more time to formally respond.
WCPFC12,441,"China could not make a formal response at WCPFC12, but would try to provide feedback to SPC intersessionally."
WCPFC12,442,The Commission adopted the SC11 Report. 12.2 NC11
WCPFC12,443,"The Chair of NC, M. Miyahara, gave a presentation on the NC11 meeting which was held in Sapporo, Japan from 31 August – 3 September 2015. Canada, Fiji, Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and USA were the members in attendance and there were also observers from EU, FSM, Kiribati, Mexico, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, FFA and ISC. As a quorum (8 Members) was not achieved in Sapporo, NC met briefly in the margins at WCPFC12 to formally adopt the NC11 report. Discussions on Pacific bluefin tuna at NC11 including the Provisional Multi-Annual Rebuilding Plan starting in 2015, the initial goal of which is to rebuild the SSB to the historical median (42,592t) within 10 years with at least 60% probability. Implementation and progress of the plan will be reviewed in 2016. Reference points and WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)63  harvest control rules for the long term management will be developed at NC in 2015 and 2016. CMM 2014-04 for Pacific bluefin tuna provides for fishing effort below the 2002-2004 levels, catch limit for small fish (<30kg) reduced to 50% of the 2002-2004 levels and for large fish (>=30kg) to not increase from 2002-2004 levels, with recruitment monitoring to be established and applied. Projection of SSB under 50% small fish catch reduction under the measure shows that SSB will recover to around 68,000t, which is well above the initial goal of 42,592t even in the pessimistic scenario; low recruitment continues in next 10 years, which has never been observed in the stock’s history. NC11 recommended the incorporation of an emergency rule paragraph in the measure for when drastic drops of recruitment are detected. Discussions on North Pacific albacore included the development of reference points and harvest control rules, with agreement to advance the work on MSE at a workshop in April 2016. On North Pacific Swordfish there were discussions about the development of reference points and harvest control rules. NC11 also discussed North Pacific blue shark, with NC requesting the Commission to instruct the SC to undertake the work on determination of the designation of north pacific blue shark as a northern stock based on the information provided by ISC to SC11 and instruct SPC to analyze the available information and coordinate with ISC if further information is necessary. Finally, NC11 agreed to request the Chair to contact IATTC Secretariat to arrange a joint meeting on PBF management in conjunction with the next NC meeting. The NC Chair announced that he would contact the IATTC Executive Secretary during the meeting."
WCPFC12,444,"A number of CCMs including the USA thanked the NC Chair for his leadership. However, USA expressed disappointment that the management of Pacific bluefin tuna was the barest minimum needed, with NC11 a missed opportunity to have a meaningful discussion about its long term management. USA commented that NC members have a responsibility to recover Pacific bluefin tuna then manage the stock throughout the Pacific Ocean using the best available science. USA hoped NC members will provide feedback on its two proposals for Pacific bluefin tuna so that NC12 can adopt measures to recover and appropriately manage the stock, including implementing biologically-based reference points for the management framework and long-term rebuilding objectives. USA recognized that the current interim rebuilding target is based on the historic biomass level and took the view that NC needs to explore a more appropriate target, based on the best available science."
WCPFC12,445,Korea recognised the importance of NC in conserving northern stocks and the serious state of Pacific bluefin tuna. Korea expressed the view that the Commission needs to strengthen its efforts to conserve these northern stocks and strengthen collaboration with IATTC and with the CDS-IWG in developing a scheme which will cover Pacific bluefin tuna. Korea registered its interest in collaborating with these organizations and working groups.
WCPFC12,446,"FFA members expressed disappointment that NC11 did not achieve a quorum, reiterating their concerns that the Commission may not be as well informed about the work of the NC as other subsidiary bodies. FFA members noted that while NC has a dedicated role to lead on the management of northern stocks, it is the Commission that is responsible and accountable, noting that the Commission is rightly concerned about the bigeye tuna stock but it is four times as healthy as the Pacific bluefin stock. FFA members stressed the need for additional management attention to ensure that the stock is rebuilt to the LRP and treated as a whole-of-WCPFC priority rather than a task for NC alone, requesting that Pacific bluefin tuna be given additional priority in SC, TCC and NC next year, as well as treated as a key issue on the WCPFC13 agenda."
WCPFC12,447,"Canada was pleased with the steps taken to begin the MSE process for North Pacific Albacore, building upon the Precautionary Approach Framework adopted last year. Canada noted the ISC-led workshop in April to finalize management objectives and trusted that other NC members will also participate. Canada echoed USA’s disappointment with the lack of progress on Pacific bluefin tuna, given the poor status of the stock, and hoped that the joint IATTC-NC meeting provides an opportunity to WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)64  undertake work rebuilding the stock and developing harvest strategies, taking into account the 2016 stock assessment."
WCPFC12,448,"EU attaches great importance to the work of NC even though it is not a member, and was pleased to send an EU scientist to NC11 to assist the sub-committee’s work. EU shared the concerns of others at the limited progress achieved so far. EU noted that the depletion ratio in 2012 was estimated as less than 6%, exceeding almost all biological LRPs commonly used in fisheries management, and took the view that the measures recently adopted by WCPFC and IATTC are not commensurate with the gravity of the situation for Pacific bluefin tuna. EU made reference to ICCAT, which has successfully recovered the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, for which fishermen made important sacrifices. EU asked whether the target of the multiannual rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna is going to be above the 20% of unfished biomass, considering that BMSY, or an appropriate proxy, should be the ultimate rebuilding target. EU also queried whether the NC workplan proposes work on agreeing reference points, acceptable levels of risk and a monitoring strategy, as the only item listed for agreement in the workplan was the emergency rule. EU encouraged harmonising approaches with harvest control work being undertaken for other tuna species. EU advised that it is interested in participating in the process of dialogue for the implementation of harvest control rules and MSE for north Pacific albacore and in participating in the new assessment cycle for Pacific bluefin tuna. EU welcomed the invitation of IATTC to the next NC meeting and supported a common approach for all tuna species under the purview of the Commission, including Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC12,449,"The NC Chair explained that discussions are still taking place on reference points and harvest control rules for the long term management of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock as scheduled in CMM 2014-04. It was noted that exploitation levels over the last 60 years has fluctuated, but was always below 20% of BO, even in periods of no fishing activity, causing some to question about the use of B0 for setting up a target level. Projection of SSB under CMM 2014-04 showed SSB will recover to a relatively high level in 2024. NC would discuss the long term target and limit levels with scientists, managers and stakeholders. Regarding the NC work plan, the North Pacific albacore tasks were clear: try to establish a TRP next year if possible, or during the trial of MSE, hopefully by 2017. NC will seek to develop both an LRP and TRP next year for Pacific bluefin, and, after looking at the progress of MSE for North Pacific albacore, try to apply MSE to Pacific bluefin tuna. NC will discuss risks, probability and associated tuning information for both stocks. Regarding ICCAT discussions will take place in July 2016 for implementation of harvest control rules for North Atlantic albacore. Regarding IATTC, it was noted that Mexico was actively engaged in discussions this year as a CNM. It was hoped that the IATTC Commission would approve the results of a NC-IATTC joint meeting by the end of 2016."
WCPFC12,450,"China commented that it represented a small market for North Pacific albacore but a larger one for Pacific bluefin tuna, noting that it imports a sizeable volume of fresh product from Japan. Regarding the CDS being developed, this CCM hoped that the discussions and experiences of the ICCAT document system would be taken into account. China advised that it will attend next year’s NC meeting."
WCPFC12,451,The EU asked that the detailed workplan be annexed to the NC report. This CCM welcomed the NC consideration of the CDS for Pacific bluefin tuna and asked that the discussions be kept aligned if possible.
WCPFC12,452,Chinese Taipei took the opportunity to express concerns about the stock status of Pacific bluefin tuna. This CCM looked forward to work on more stringent conservation and management which will take into account the results of new stock assessment next year.
WCPFC12,453,PNG noted that SC has had difficulties assessing the situation of blue shark due to the lack of operational data and hoped SC12 will be provided with this data. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)65
WCPFC12,454,The IATTC Director Dr Compeán noted IATTC Resolution C-14-06 which calls for cooperation with the WCPFC and bilaterally with concerned members to cooperate in the rebuilding of this stock. Dr Compeán commented that IATTC will cooperate with WCPFC to achieve this.
WCPFC12,455,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF, Greenpeace, and ISSF, Pew expressed ongoing and deep concern with the state of Pacific bluefin, stressing that urgent action is needed to reverse its declining stock status. Even with full implementation of existing conservation measures, the Pacific bluefin population will decline through 2018, and in the next decade, there is a 1:3 chance it will drop to the lowest level ever recorded; it is currently approximately 4% of unfished biomass. These observer organizations welcomed FFA’s comments and urged the Commission to provide a clear direction to NC to take further and greater action to reduce mortality of this stock. They urged the Commission to: direct NC to prepare a robust work plan for north Pacific bluefin tuna that includes all of the elements in para. 7 of CMM 2014-06; specify that the work plan be submitted to the Commission no later than WCPFC13; and specify that the work plan shall include an objective to rebuild the population of north Pacific bluefin to a level capable of producing MSY by 2030."
WCPFC12,456,"Japan expressed concerns about the depleted stock status of Pacific bluefin tuna. This CCM noted that it worked very hard to establish CMM 2014-04 and thus made best efforts to implement this CMM in cooperation with other interested nations, including members of NC. Japan noted the importance of the species for Japan and WCPFC members and thus it was important that NC’s activities were understood, and information sharing through SC and TCC was helping this. In this context all SIDS members have been invited as an observer to NC meetings in accordance with current WCPFC rules. Japan noted that there was a two year plan to consider reference points and harvest control rules. This CCM noted that while the proposal from USA had been actively discussed with unfortunately no conclusion, Japan was ready to contribute to constructive discussions through the next year."
WCPFC12,457,"The Commission agreed to amend CMM 2014-04 (Pacific Bluefin) (see Attachment N, CMM 2015-04)."
WCPFC12,458,"The Commission tasked the SC to undertake the work on determination of the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock, based on the information provided by ISC to SC11. In this regard, the Commission tasked the Scientific Services Provider with analyzing the available information and coordinating with ISC if further information is necessary."
WCPFC12,459,The Commission adopted the NC11 Report. 12.3 TCC11
WCPFC12,460,"The TCC Vice-Chair presented the Summary Report of the 11th Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (WCPFC12-2015-19 and 19b) held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia 23- 29 September 2015, noting the apologies of the TCC Chair A. Cole (USA).  Both reports were taken as read. It was noted that TCC11 recommendations related to WCPFC12 agenda items 4, 6, 9, 10 and 11 have also partially been covered in discussions to date, with outstanding and pending items addressed here. It was noted that the presentation of recommendations under this agenda tiem would be only items of substance, but members were advised that all TCC11 recommendations were covered in WCPFC12-2015-19b.  The Summary Report of TCC Special Session (2015) (WCPFC12-2015-19e) was considered under Agenda 13.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)66  General recommendations on WCPFC IUU Vessel List"
WCPFC12,461,"General recommendations about the WCPFC IUU Vessel List were made in TCC11 Summary Report paragraphs 95-98, where TCC11 encouraged cooperation between CCMs to locate vessels on the list and, for vessels retained on the list for a long time, the Secretariat would write to flag states to establish if new information was available and to other RFMOs seeking further information. It was also recommended that communications regarding IUU allegation be conducted in English."
WCPFC12,462,"In respect of TCC11 recommendation paragraph 97 and 98, the Compliance Manager confirmed that the letters to flag states were sent on 22 October 2015 and were available on the secure side of the Commission website in WCPFC12-2015-08."
WCPFC12,463,"The Commission agreed on the importance of strengthening cooperation among all CCMs to actively work together to locate the vessels that are on the WCPFC IUU vessel list, so as to stop their illegal activities. Such cooperation should include, as appropriate and as applicable to each CCM:  a. prompt advice to the Commission Secretariat from any Flag State or other CCM who has information on any vessel on the WCPFC IUU list, including its whereabouts and any known change in name or other circumstance. In addition, Port States are requested to take any appropriate action, including, if possible, denial of port entry and services to those vessels.  b. greater scrutiny of the individuals and companies that have been involved in IUU fishing, and the sharing of this information between CCMs and RFMOs."
WCPFC12,464,"The Commission tasked the Commission Secretariat to write to the Flag States of the IUU vessels on the WCPFC IUU list, following WCPFC12 and annually in advance of TCC, to identify their last known operations and track their whereabouts and to advise the Commission of any findings."
WCPFC12,465,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to write a letter to other RFMOs annually in advance of TCC, requesting their cooperation to locate those vessels listed on the WCPFC IUU list as at the date of the annual TCC meeting, and as applicable underlining circumstances when a vessel is listed on other RFMO IUU lists, and for the Secretariat to provide an update to the regular annual session of the Commission on any responses from RFMOs."
WCPFC12,466,The Commission agreed that English language is to be used in all communications between relevant CCMs regarding alleged IUU activities. List of CMM paragraphs to be reviewed by CMR
WCPFC12,467,"A suggested list of obligations to be assessed in 2016 and beyond – including suggested frequency of assessment was presented (WCPFC12-2015-DP20_rev2). With thanks to the USA for leading this work, it was noted that the draft removes obligations which were redundant or which posed difficulties determining which obligation was being assessed."
WCPFC12,468,There were no comments on this list.
WCPFC12,469,The Commission agreed to the list of obligations to be assessed by CMS in 2016-2018 and the agreed frequency for assessment of CMMs in forward years (Attachment O).
WCPFC12,470,"The Compliance Manager advised the Commission that the Secretariat had circulated WCPFC12-2015-19g, which contains the individual CMM paras corresponding to the list of CMMs in DP20_rev1. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)67  Noting the adoption of DP20_rev2, the Secretariat will update that document to reflect the amendments captured in WCPFC12-2015-DP20_rev2."
WCPFC12,471,The Secretariat was tasked with producing an accompanying paper that provides the detail of CMM paragraphs which will be used by the Secretariat to implement the agreed list of obligations to be assessed in dCMR (Attachment O).
WCPFC12,472,The recommendation that the Commission consider a revised timeframe for annual reporting for the CMS process for 2016 and beyond would be considered in the revision of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMM. Recommendations to revise CMMs prioritised by CMS process which were ambiguous or problematic
WCPFC12,473,The TCC Vice-Chair noted that South Pacific albacore and shark discussions were pending under agenda item 10 and sharks 11.1. TCC11’s recommendations in paras. 482-485 to revise CMMs prioritised by CMS process which were ambiguous or problematic were discussed.
WCPFC12,474,The Chair explained that TCC11 Summary Report paragraphs. 482-483 were asking the Commission to agree to not assess certain obligations.
WCPFC12,475,"EU noted that TCC decided not to assess these obligations because TCC did not have the means to assess them. However, para. 483 (regarding the tropical tuna measure) recommended that para. 28 not be assessed until appropriate limits have been formulated. EU hoped to agree those limits at this meeting on appropriate limits to be able to be assessed next year and noted that SC has a recommendation relating to this."
WCPFC12,476,"The Chair noted that WCPFC12 would be discussing yellowfin catch limits, and suggested that the Commission accept the TCC recommendation paragraph 483 and note that the Commission was looking at limits."
WCPFC12,477,"The Chair further noted that para. 484 asked for a clarification of what is meant by the term current paras. 49, 51 and 52 of CMM 2013-01 and suggested that views on this could be included in the SWG discussions, along with the clarification requested in para. 485 about how to assess para. 40. There were no objections to this."
WCPFC12,478,The Commission agreed that CMM 2007-01 paragraph 8 should not be assessed for compliance provided that all the individual associated obligations are assessed.
WCPFC12,479,"Due to TCC’s inability to assess the obligation in CMM 2013-01, paragraph 28 (yellowfin tuna purse seine catch) until appropriate limits have been formulated and adopted, the Commission agreed that it should not be included as part of the Compliance Monitoring Report assessment. Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)"
WCPFC12,480,"Regarding para. 211, which called on the Secretariat to publish and maintain a list of all RFV vessels’ WCPFC VMS reporting status, the Compliance Manager drew the Commission’s attention to WCPFC12-2015-19b Attachment 1, in which the Secretariat had prepared supporting details and the Secretariat’s thoughts on how they will implement this."
WCPFC12,481,"Japan thanked the Secretariat for the development of Attachment 1 and expressed the view that the date submitted to the communications provider was especially important to add. Japan stated that this WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)68  additional information would decrease the numbers of situations where the WCPFC VMS system cannot receive information from vessels, when the flag state VMS can receive the information. This CCM’s suggestion was to alter one of the columns to provide the ‘date of submission to VMS satellite provider’."
WCPFC12,482,Chinese Taipei asked exactly what details from the vessel tracking agreement form (VTAF) are proposed to be included in the list?
WCPFC12,483,"In response to Japan's suggestion, the Compliance Manager observed that is may not be possible to have comprehensive detail on the date a VTAF was submitted to the communication provider for all the vessels, noting that this information has only been compiled electronically for the last two years. However, the Secretariat has good records of thedate a particular MTU commenced reporting to the WCPFC VMS, and this was the reason for the inclusion of such a date in the list which confirms that the MTU was reporting at one point. In response to Chinese Taipei’s question about VTAF details, the Secretariat confirmed that the specific VTAF details would not be available for other CCMs to access through the list and would be held in WCPFC Secretariat databases, the list would simply confirm when the VTAF details were received by the Secretariat and the date that the MTU first reported to the WCPFC VMS."
WCPFC12,484,"Japan confirmed it was happy to go back to the original wording, and that it was more important to keep the information in the list."
WCPFC12,485,"Australia asked that a note indicating when the list was last updated is included, for clarity."
WCPFC12,486,The Chair agreed that would be helpful.
WCPFC12,487,There were no more comments on this matter.
WCPFC12,488,"The Commission agreed that by June 30 2016 the Secretariat should publish and maintain through secure CCM WCPFC online systems, that are accessible by authorised CCM users, a list of all RFV vessels WCPFC VMS reporting status. The list will be updated a least once a week, and will be based on the details of vessels as contained in the RFV. The list will confirm those vessels which VTAF details are held by WCPFC and where applicable the date of receipt, date of last update of the list, and date of first VMS report to WCPFC (VTAF activation date), the current VMS reporting channel to the WCPFC VMS (for example WCPFC direct; through FFA; manual reporting or not reporting) (Attachment P). Regional Observer Programme data fields"
WCPFC12,489,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the ROP (para. 285), to adopt changes as set out in Attachment E (WCPFC-TCC11-2015-26_rev1) to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Minimum Data Standards and Fields. The Secretariat tabled the attachment from the TCC11 report as a standalone document (WCPFC12-2015-19f) for easy reference."
WCPFC12,490,There were no objections to the adoption of these changes.
WCPFC12,491,"The Commission noted that in the proposed changes to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Minimum Data Standards and Fields some fields are new, some represent splits of prior fields and some are existing fields with new text, otherwise all other fields remain the same."
WCPFC12,492,The Commission adopted the changes to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Minimum Data Standards and Fields (Attachment Q).  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)69  High Seas Boarding and Inspection Scheme (HSBI)
WCPFC12,493,The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to High Seas Boarding and Inspection Scheme (HSBI) (para. 319) and tasking to the Secretariat.
WCPFC12,494, There were no objections to this tasking.
WCPFC12,495,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to develop an online technical solution to make available to authorized CCM MCS personnel, through secure login, a list of vessels that have been previously inspected under the HSBI scheme specifically, the VID, Vessel Name, IRCS, date of boarding and Name of inspecting member.  Record of Fishing Vessels"
WCPFC12,496,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to completion of minimum required RFV fields, and instruction to the Secretariat to remove vessels (para. 345)."
WCPFC12,497,Korea commented that it was in the process of trying to delete old vessels from the RFV but some vessels lack the minimum required information needed to enable this deletion. Korea noted that these vessels were registered before the revised CMM entered into force.
WCPFC12,498,"China noted the importance of having comprehensive information on the list, however did not think it was appropriate that fishing vessels without complete information could be removed by the Secretariat directly. This CCM suggested that if a vessel on the RFV is lacking information, the Secretariat should notify the flag state and urge it to provide the missing information; the flag state can take the steps required to rectify the problem and should have the final decision to remove the vessel from the list."
WCPFC12,499,"The Chair noted that China’s suggestion would change the nature of and negate some parts of the recommendation and put the responsibility on the flag state to remove the vessel, with the Secretariat’s role being to notify the flag state at a certain point in time, and asked for comments on this."
WCPFC12,500,"The Secretariat advised that it was able to take on the tasking in the recommendation. The Compliance Manager confirmed that, if the recommendation was accepted, the Secretariat intended to ensure CCMs are advised which vessels would fall into this category, noting that only a few CCMs had vessels in this situation. The Secretariat confirmed that they could advise relevant CCMs well before the 30 June deadline in the recommendation. The Compliance Manager reminded the Commission that the system does not allow new vessels to be listed without the minimum required fields."
WCPFC12,501,"USA agreed that the suggested change negates the TCC recommendation, suggesting that given the explanation from the Secretariat regarding vessels currently on the list with incomplete information, the recommendation should be accepted as is or defer the adoption of the recommendation."
WCPFC12,502,China accepted the recommendation with the Secretariat’s explanation and assistance.
WCPFC12,503,"The Commission agreed that all vessels on the RFV shall complete the minimum required fields by 30 June 2016, and instructed the Secretariat to remove any vessels without the minimum required data fields after that date.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)70"
WCPFC12,504,"The Secretariat confirmed that during the first half of 2016 it will provide advice to the relevant flag CCMs whose vessel records on the RFV contain gaps in the minimum required fields, so that the relevant flag CCM may take appropriate steps in advance of the 30 June 2016 deadline. Tier-scoring system for data provision"
WCPFC12,505,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the three TCC recommendations relating to the review, refinement and possible use to assist in the evaluation of other CMMs, of the tier scoring system (para. 387-389)."
WCPFC12,506,"In response to a query about whether the recommendation had any budget implications, the Secretariat noted its understanding that the work would be part of the regular support SPC provides and the regular data paper SPC prepares for SC."
WCPFC12,507,The Commission agreed that the tier scoring system adopted at WCPFC11 shall be used to assist in assessing compliance of CCMs for the provision of scientific data in 2016 and following years.
WCPFC12,508,"The Commission tasked SPC with further refining the tier scoring system to provide, among other things, an indicator of compliance of CCMs as a whole with provision of scientific data."
WCPFC12,509,"The Commission agreed to explore the usefulness of using the tier scoring system to assist in the evaluation of compliance with other CMMs, including the possible development of an indicator of overall compliance of each CCM in relation to the totality of agreed WCPFC obligations. Charter Notification Scheme"
WCPFC12,510,The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the charter notification scheme and its extension of the measure for the next three years (para. 497).
WCPFC12,511,"The Commission agreed to extend CMM 2012-05 (Charter Notification Scheme), which expires at the end of 2015 for the next three years (Attachment R). TCC Workplan 2016- 2018"
WCPFC12,512,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the TCC work plan (para. 517), discussions on which Australia led in the margins of WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,513,"Australia reported that WCPFC12-2015-DP21_rev1 had been posted and includes comments from one CCM. A SWG had met and there were some additional changes. There was still a clarification outstanding under subparagraph L of the draft TCC work plan regarding sharks, and the table was altered to accommodate some of the bigeye tuna overfishing tasks."
WCPFC12,514,"Finalisation of the work plan was held open until the completion of the shark-related discussions. On 8 December, Australia reported that after discussions in the margins, the revised TCC work plan was ready for adoption. There was agreement to delete sub-paragraph L – sharks."
WCPFC12,515,"The Chair asked if the Commission agreed to delete sub-paragraph L and accept the 2016-2018 TCC workplan, in light of the outcome on WCPFC12-2015-DP26_rev1."
WCPFC12,516,"EU asked why it needed to be deleted, noting that one opposing delegation had been concerned it would weaken the fins naturally attached proposal. EU confirmed there were no alternative ways, and that WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)71  EU would be strengthening its proposal. This CCM noted that several delegations noted this issue was to be discussed at TCC."
WCPFC12,517,The Chair asked if there were objections to allowing TCC to consider alternatives with respect to sharks (sub-paragraph L).
WCPFC12,518,China supported maintaining the sub-paragraph but replacing the reference to the ‘finning ban’ with a reference to the relevant measure.
WCPFC12,519,"EU recalled that the choices are either to use the fins naturally attached method or the fin-to-carcass ratio and noted that TCC had called for the Commission to help as it could not evaluate the 5% fin-to-carcass ratio. It was noted that this impasse had led to TCC not even assessing compliance with the shark measure in 2015, and this language gave TCC some guidance."
WCPFC12,520,"After brief discussions, the language was cleared."
WCPFC12,521,The Commission adopted the TCC Workplan 2016-2018 (Attachment S).  WCPFC Information Management System (IMS)
WCPFC12,522,The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the Secretariat IMS and website (para. 522).
WCPFC12,523,There were no comments on or objections to this recommendation.
WCPFC12,524,The Commission agreed to maintain commitments that will ensure the continued development and enhancement of the Commission Secretariat IMS over the next 2-3 years.
WCPFC12,525,China noted that discussions took place at TCC11 about GMT being used in relation to reporting deadlines and asked for confirmation whether this was included in the amended CMS measure.
WCPFC12,526,The TCC Vice-Chair confirmed that GMT was included in the current draft of the measure which is intended to replace CMM 2014-07.
WCPFC12,527,The Chair thanked the TCC Vice-Chair for presenting the recommendations from TCC11.  12.3.1 CDS-IWG (Work Plan)
WCPFC12,528,"On behalf of the CDS-IWG Chair, A. Kinol (PNG), who could not attend WCPFC12, the Compliance Manager gave a brief summary of the CDS-IWG work this year, noting there had been a productive 2-day session held from 21 - 22 September 2015, immediately prior to TCC11 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. It had been one of the most involved discussions on a possible CDS scheme that the Commission has had to date and it resulted in a considerable work plan for CCMs to progress through 2016."
WCPFC12,529,"The Commission received the TCC11 recommendations on the CDS-IWG report and work plan (WCPFC12-2015-19c). Para. 414 of the TCC11 report contained a recommendation relating to the CDS-IWG and WCPFC12-2015-19b Table 3 (starting on page 23) contained recommendations from the CDS-IWG. Referring to the work plan and timeline, which is the page 26 attachment to the working paper, the Compliance Manager noted the four broad groups of activities to be progressed by the CDS working group: the scope of work, a program of intersessional work related to the development of CDS standards, WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)72  Mass Balance Reconciliation (with a trial agreed, with a 2013 calendar reference year), and CMM development. It was noted that para. 40 of the doc still referred to Pacific bluefin in square brackets as, despite discussions at TCC11 the inclusion of this species had not been agreed in the CDS-IWG outcomes."
WCPFC12,530,"In respect of the proposed Mass Balance Reconciliation trial (the Compliance Manager referred the meeting to WCPFC12-2015-19b Attachment 3 (pages 33 – 36), and noted that the trial involves as a first step that CCMs include in their 2016 Annual Report Part 1 certain extra data on disposal, receipt and redistribution of bigeye, yellowfin, skipjack and albacore species for 2013 calendar year.  At CDS-IWG and during TCC11 many CCMs had noted their expectation that their reporting was likely to be incomplete.  This was also expected to present challenges for the Secretariat to try to undertake a detailed mass balance reconciliation analysis of the 2013 submitted information.  The Secretariat has set out in Attachment 3 an alternative approach to that originally proposed during the CDS-IWG, which is that the Secretariat would compile the available information from CCMs Annual Report Part 1 into two tables, which would be circulated for the CDS-IWG in 2016. At this point there were no budgetary implications of this work."
WCPFC12,531,The Chair thanked the Chair of the CDS-IWG in his absence and the Compliance Manager for her brief presentation.
WCPFC12,532,The Commission accepted TCC11’s recommendations with the Secretariat’s proposed modifications to the 2016 Mass Balance Reconciliation tasking and adopted the report of the CDS-IWG (WCPFC12-2015-19c) and the 2016 CDS-IWG work plan (Attachment T).  12.3.2 ERandEM-IWG (Work Plan)
WCPFC12,533,"The Commission received and discussed the TCC’s recommendations on the report (TCC11 Summary Report para 397), the ERandEM-IWG recommendations (WCPFC12-2015-19b Table 4) and work plan of the ERandEM-IWG (WCPFC12-2015-19d). The Chair of the ERandEM-IWG, K. Smith (Australia) presented WCPFC12-2015-19d, a brief summary of the working group’s activities in 2015. The ERandEM-IWG met in July in Nadi, Fiji in conjunction with the IWG-ROP meeting. A priority task for the group was to consider data standards, specifications and procedures for the electronic submission of observer and operational catch and effort data. The workshop considered draft SSPs developed by SPC and the WCPFC Secretariat and noted that they gave effect to and were consistent with current regional requirements relating to data fields and data submission. A number of existing international standards are also included. The draft SSPs covered Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area reporting (CMM 2010-02), High Seas Pocket One Special Management Area reporting (CMM 2014-01), manual position reporting in the event of an ALC/MTU failure, operational level catch and effort data and observer data. The Chair noted that a number of CCMs committed to work with the Science Provider to test and further refine the electronic data standards and strongly encouraged those CCMs to work with the Secretariat and SPC to progress this work."
WCPFC12,534,"The ERandEM-IWG Chair reiterated that a decision to adopt the standards does not make e-reporting mandatory, but supports those countries looking to implement E-reporting as part of domestic processes. The adoption of standards will also ensure that the Secretariat’s databases and systems are ready to receive and exchange data. Many of the data fields are used frequently in WCPFC’s reporting such as vessel name, vessel type, species codes, latitude/longitude and, as such, there are clear linkages and efficiencies for close engagement with other IWGs."
WCPFC12,535,"The ERandEM-IWG noted the numerous trials that were underway in relation to E-monitoring and noted that E-reporting standards support the development of E-monitoring. The working group noted WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)73  that E-monitoring should be considered in fisheries where there is a higher perceived risk to the safety of observers and that electronic forms of data submission should be authenticated to support compliance investigations. Next steps for the group included testing of the draft SSPs and further refinement, consideration of E-monitoring standards, review of progress against the terms of reference and workplan. WCPFC12 endorsed the recommendations in paragraph 397 (a, b, c, d, e) of the TCC11 report."
WCPFC12,536,"The ERandEM-IWG Chair was thanked for her efforts to progress work in this area, with the Commission Chair noting that it contributes valuably to the Commission’s data."
WCPFC12,537,"On behalf of the Pew Charitable Trusts, Humane Society International, and WWF, Pew thanked the Chair of the ERandEM-IWG, the Secretariat and SPC for the working group’s important work. These organizations noted that reporting, monitoring and observing of vessels in the Convention area continues to be a challenge, particularly for some of the longline fleets who struggle to reach the 5% coverage of effort level and opined that this hampers scientific efforts, which require a minimum of 20% observer coverage. It was noted that Electronic monitoring has been shown to offer a viable complement to observers, and encouraged CCMs to submit data necessary to test the E-reporting standards. These organizations encouraged continued work of the ERandEM-IWG and for TCC and the Commission to adopt proposed E-reporting and E-monitoring standards swiftly, to allow those countries who are seeking to implement these technologies to do so, be consistent with one another, and facilitate data and information sharing."
WCPFC12,538,"In response to a question about whether the ERandEM-IWG agreed to the draft SSPs for the five key areas, the ERandEM-IWG Chair advised that the working group had agreed to the draft SSPs but had noted that further testing was required; this testing had not yet been undertaken."
WCPFC12,539,The Commission accepted TCC11s recommendation and adopted the ERandEM-IWG report and work plan (WCPFC-TCC11-2015-19d).
WCPFC12,540,"The Commission noted that further testing and refinement of the five draft electronic data standards developed in 2015 (WCPFC-TCC11-2015-20, Attachment 5) is required by the ERandEM-IWG."
WCPFC12,541,The Commission agreed that a master list of electronic data standards shall be maintained by the Secretariat with input from the Scientific Services Provider and any updates shall be notified to CCMs on an annual basis.
WCPFC12,542,The Commission noted advice from the ERandEM-IWG supported by TCC that a decision to report electronically in future be captured by an amendment to the relevant CMM which also makes reference to the master list.
WCPFC12,543,The Commission encouraged the development of Electronic Monitoring by CCMs in areas where data gaps exist such as longline observer coverage and high seas transhipment.
WCPFC12,544,The Commission noted that the ERandEM-IWG should meet prior to SC12 in 2016. 12.4 IWG-ROP
WCPFC12,545,"The Commission received and discussed the report of the Regional Observer Programme – Intersessional Working Group (IWG-ROP) (WCPFC12-2015-21), that included proposed revisions to CMM 2009-06 on carrier notification of intent to transship (WCPFC12-2015-21a) and IWG-ROP pre-notification process for alleged infringements (WCPFC12-2015-21b). The IWG-ROP Chair, R. Clarke WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)74  (USA) gave a brief summary of the working group’s activities in 2015. The IWG-ROP met 6 – 8 July 2015 in Nadi, Fiji. The Commission had tasked the IWG-ROP to work on a number of elements, through different bodies of the Commission: preventing and deterring alcohol-related misconduct of observers, ROP identification cards, high seas transshipment monitoring, processes to facilitate the provision of data, including observer reports, from the observer providers and placement information from Flag States to the Commission, ROP coverage on longline vessels, along with the definition of the responsibilities of observer providers and flag states. The attachments to the IWG-ROP meeting report included a recommended modification to CMM 2009-06 on transhipment."
WCPFC12,546,"The IWG-ROP meeting report was presented to both SC11 and TCC11, garnering no specific comments. Given the technical nature of the report recommendations, it was decided that two of the substantive recommendations should be summarised and distributed for review by CCMs in advance of WCPFC12 (Circular 2015/82 of 13 November 2015). In that circular three areas were highlighted:  a) IWG-ROP-recommended changes to the transshipment measure for carrier notification of intent to tranship and observer information,  b) pre-notification process from observer providers to flag CCMs of possible alleged infringements by their vessels, and  c) sourcing of observers and the implementation of ‘hybrid approach’."
WCPFC12,547,"With regard to the proposal to provide the Secretariat with additional information related to observer placements on carriers in the Convention area, comments from one group of CCMs during WCPFC12 indicated that they were not comfortable with the proposed recommendation of the IWG-ROP and, despite work in the margins of WCPFC12, these concern could not be resolved. The IWG-ROP Chair recommends that the proposed amendments to CMM 2009-06 be referred back to TCC for further work including, and potentially be included in larger modifications to the measure as proposed by some delegations. The IWG-ROP Chair noted the importance that the Secretariat be well informed about observers on carrier vessels given growing concerns related to health and safety, and hoped this work will continue to be considered a priority of the TCC."
WCPFC12,548,"On the second substantive recommendation related to pre-notification process from observer providers to flag CCMs of possible alleged infringements by their vessels, the IWG-ROP reported that informal discussions with CCMs suggests that this IWG-ROP recommendation is likely to have a more positive outcome. At IWG-ROP4 a detailed recommendation was agreed with an equally detailed procedure developed (found in Attachment 7 of the IWG-ROP Summary Report (WCPFC12-2015-21)), relating to a pre-notification process for alleged infringements. This essentially involved expediting the regionally utilized observer GEN-3 form (to be renamed WCPFC Observer Trip Monitoring Summaries), which is a checklist marked by the observers upon disembarking the vessel in the recommended manner which includes a summary to be provided to the vessel operator in a manner that ensures the safety of the observer and the integrity of the data. A flow chart was developed by the Secretariat that describes how the process would be implemented, in response to a suggestion from RMI at TCC11. The figure is shown in WCPFC12-2015-21b."
WCPFC12,549,"The Observer Programme Coordinator explained the process in more detail for WCPFC12. The GEN-3 document is handed over with other relevant data by the observer to the observer provider which ideally involves the debriefer. If no allegations or infringements are reported, by the observer (no boxes checked) the form is sent to the data provider as usual for entry into the database. If there were allegations or alleged infringement noted, the observer provider first ensures that the observer is not going on any further (immediate) trips on that vessel and the observer provider can make the decision about the WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)75  appropriate time to submit a pre-notification to the Secretariat. The dates of the trip will be identified as part of the pre-notification. The Secretariat will analyse the GEN-3 form and (where the relevant fields are ticked) they will communicate the alleged infringement at the request of the flag state in a timely manner as possible; the flag state has the discretion to communicate with the vessel and request additional information from the observer provider to support an investigation."
WCPFC12,550,The IWG-ROP Chair noted that he had received one comment on the proposed process – that the coastal state in whose waters the allegation has occurred should be included in any notification scheme. There was no objection to this proposal.
WCPFC12,551,"The Compliance Manager commented on the practical aspects of the proposed modification to the IWG-ROP process.  She noted that it was a matter for the Commission to specify the circumstances under which the pre-notification process would operate.  She further noted that initially it is expected that only once the Secretariat receives through SPC-OFP the full ROP data for a particular trip, that the location where any alleged infringements occurred would be able to be determined. Whereas currently the GEN-3 form does not have detail on the exact position where an alleged infringement takes place, so the Secretariat would not be able to direct the pre-notification information to the relevant coastal CCM until it is provided with the data to confirm which EEZ would be the applicable one to receive the pre-notification. The Compliance Manager noted that if the principle of the process is agreed, it would undertake to implement this the process based on the available information."
WCPFC12,552,"On the third substantive recommendation, the IWG-ROP Chair noted that limited progress was made at the IWG-ROP on the issue of sourcing of observers and the hybrid approach. One recommendation was that CCMs were to provide to the Commission a list of the national observer programs they are associated with for observers placed on their longline vessels. In summation of the elements highlighted in the circular, the IWG-ROP Chair also addressed the issue of the continued tenure of the working group, noting there has to be real consideration of the cost of holding these meetings. It was noted that the transshipment notification amendment would not be recommended to the Commission. With the modification of the coastal state being included, the IWG-ROP report was recommended for the Commission’s approval."
WCPFC12,553,"The Commission Chair thanked the IWG-ROP Chair for his efforts in 2015, and noted that holding the meetings was an expensive process. The Commission considered the three main elements in turn. The first element related to transshipment and the IWG-ROP had requested that TCC do further work on amendments to the measure."
WCPFC12,554,"RMI noted the linkages between the ROP and issues with transshipment in general and that when discussions turn to transshipment issues those recommendations can be raised again. This CCM considered that work on transshipment issues needed to continue, and noted that the TCC would be looking at strengthening the measure."
WCPFC12,555,"The Chair sought for clarification that the Commission was going to task the TCC with taking a further look at the issue of transshipment and provide some guidance to the Commission on CMM 2009-06. There may be a need to look at the ROP measure, given the multitude of cross-linkages. On these specific recommendations we are looking to task TCC with taking another look. There were no objections to the Chair’s proposal."
WCPFC12,556,"The Commission noted the IWG-ROP’s recommendations on carrier notification of intent to tranship including amendments to CMM 2009-06, and tasked TCC12 to further consider the proposed amendments to CMM 2009-06 (WCPFC12-2015-21a). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)76"
WCPFC12,557,"At the outset of discussions on processes to facilitate provision of observer data and placement information to the Commission, the Chair reminded WCPFC12 that some members proposed including pre-notification of the relevant coastal state."
WCPFC12,558,"The IWG-ROP Chair noted that a balance needed to be struck between observer safety and flag state requests for information and referred delegates to the process outlined in Attachment 7 of the IWG-ROP report. FFA proposed language to that about the coastal state being notified as well as the flag state, with no objection heard."
WCPFC12,559,"RMI stressed the high priority of observer safety. This CCM commented that the process has application for both purse-seine and longline observer placements and does address safety, but more work needed to be done on deterrence – avoiding issues in the first place that may compromise the safety of observers. RMI asked about the actions that are to be undertaken by the flag state to ensure safety of observer and the provision of data to respond to issues which are raised."
WCPFC12,560,The IWG-ROP Chair responded that there was a general assumption that in the cases of allegations of harassment or physical intimidation that an investigation would be initiated: the vessel would be made aware of the allegation and the enforcement authorities would become informed. There would be a two-fold response.
WCPFC12,561,"The EU supported the recommendation including the changes suggested by FFA for the relevant coastal state to also be notified and agreed it was a two-way process, with the flag state and coastal state receiving information. This CCM asked about the provision of this information being done in a ‘timely manner’, commenting that it was important for flag states to receive this information as soon as possible. This CCM was comfortable with seeing how the current proposed method works and then deciding in the future whether it needs further refinement."
WCPFC12,562,"The IWG-ROP Chair supported this, noting that the step was admittedly modest, as it is an attempt to build a larger process; if appropriate it can then be streamlined in the future. The IWG-ROP Chair stressed that this does not in any way impinge on the standard operating processes within national observer programs. These national programs may decide that the GEN-3 form can be expedited, for others that may not be the case. This is why the working group decided the process does need a strict timeline."
WCPFC12,563,"FFA members supported the recommendation to implement a pre-notification process, as a means to support CCMs, in particular flag States, to initiate responses to potential violations. In line with CMM 2013-06, and the practicalities associated with implementing the proposed notification process, these CCMs proposed a delayed implementation of six months from adoption, to provide the necessary time to establish mechanisms for its implementation. These CCMs reminded the Commission that this process was proposed by FFA members at WCPFC11, as a means of increasing the usability of ROP data by flag states for compliance purposes. At the same time, FFA members were not seeking consideration of the removal of the para. 1(c) of Attachment K, Annex B of CMM 2007-01. Noting that observer safety was highlighted this year, FFA members pointed to the necessity of keeping their observers safe as they carry out their duties, and therefore strongly recommended the removal of para. 1(c)."
WCPFC12,564,"China wanted to see that the pre-notification along with evidence, noting that without evidence it was difficult to begin an investigation. This CMM suggested that for vessels on the high seas, the flag state should be notified and has the responsibility to punish the vessel. For vessels operating in another state’s jurisdiction, that investigation should be conducted by the coastal state with punishment from the coastal state, with perhaps no need to give the flag state prior notification. This CCM commented that it had no difficulties with the phrase ‘timely manner’.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)77"
WCPFC12,565,"The IWG-ROP Chair clarified that the proposal is just for the GEN-3 form being subject to an expedited process. The flag state will receive the form from the observer provider, and, with the modification proposed by FFA, a relevant coastal state will too. For a vessel in an EEZ, the form will go to the coastal state, and for a vessel on the high seas it will go just to the flag state."
WCPFC12,566,"Korea generally agreed with the direction proposed by the IWG-ROP on this issue, but believes there need to be a way to ensure greater accessibility by the flag state to the observer report. The GEN-3 information is simply yes/no – it does not provide a detailed account of the alleged infringement including when it happened. Those things are needed by a flag state to start an investigation. Corresponding information such as observer’s journals would be helpful. This CCM hoped the IWG-ROP would continue its work to find ways for greater accessibility of this information, and suggested there also needs to be a system where information from observers and vessel masters can be cross-checked."
WCPFC12,567,Some CCMs commented that if an observer is on the high seas both parties should get the report.
WCPFC12,568,"The Chair noted that Korea was happy to go along with the proposal and clarified that the FFA had requested 6 months to implement it. The focus of this adoption would be on the pre-notification process, with later implementation."
WCPFC12,569,"The Commission adopted the pre-notification process from observer providers to flag CCMs of possible alleged infringements by their vessels and put forward by the IWG-ROP, as amended to include data being provided to the coastal state when an alleged infringement takes place in a coastal state's waters (Attachment U)."
WCPFC12,570,"The Commission agreed that all ROP authorized observer programmes provide to the Commission Secretariat in a timely manner the ROP minimum data elements on the WCPFC Observer Trip Monitoring Summary, or which are included in SPC/FFA General Form 3 (Attachment 7 to IWG-ROP4 Summary Report), as a means of supporting a pre-notification process from observer providers to flag of possible alleged infringements by their vessels. To facilitate the pre-notification process it was recommended that only those data elements answered in the affirmative by observers would be provided to the Commission Secretariat for transmittal to the flag CCM and as appropriate the relevant coastal State for alleged infringements in their waters."
WCPFC12,571,"The Commission agreed that to support the pre-notification process, that there are two additional fields that should be provided by observer providers to the Commission Secretariat to support a flag CCMs investigations of any possible alleged infringements. These are:                          1. “start date of trip and end date of trip”                          2. “status of the debriefing process” i.e, “debriefed”, “pre debriefed” or “not debriefed”"
WCPFC12,572,The Commission noted that the requirement of providing the pre-notification data elements to the Commission Secretariat may not be required where there are domestic requirements enabling access by vessel operators to observer data.
WCPFC12,573,The Commission agreed that the implementation of the pre-notification process would be delayed for six months following WCPFC12.
WCPFC12,574,"The Commission briefly took up discussions on the FFA proposal to remove para. 1(c) of Attachment K, Annex B of CMM 2007-01, however, a number of CCMs objected to the FFA proposal relating to the ability of vessel captains to see observer reports first being introduced during the agenda WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)78  item discussions rather than being submitted as a proposal in the usual way, ahead of time and in hardcopy."
WCPFC12,575,Japan noted that this was a long standing topic of discussion and recalled the intervention by China at the beginning of the meeting about appropriate notice being given for proposals. It was impossible for the Japanese delegation to discuss the issue without this notice having been given for this proposal.
WCPFC12,576,The Chair noted that the Commission was not going to achieve consensus on the proposal.
WCPFC12,577,"The Chair asked WCPFC12 what additional work it wanted the IWG-ROP to do, noting her sense that the working group has completed its tasks."
WCPFC12,578,FFA members considered that another meeting of the IWG-ROP would not resolve some of the long-standing issues relating to the implementation of the ROP. These CCMs took the view that progress can be made among CCMs intersessionally.
WCPFC12,579,"The Commission adopted the IWG-ROP report including its recommendations, except where otherwise noted herein."
WCPFC12,580,"WCPFC12 agreed that the IWG-ROP would not be tasked to meet in 2016, and thanked the IWG-ROP Chair Ray Clarke (USA) for his leadership of the group. 12.5 FAD Management Options IWG"
WCPFC12,581,"The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair, B. Kumasi (PNG), presented the report of the first FAD Management Options – Intersessional Working Group (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2). The working group, which had progressed its work electronically until the 27-28 November in Bali, Indonesia had the following terms of reference: collection of additional data on FADs and their use in WCPO fisheries; FAD marking, identification, and the use of electronic signatures; FAD monitoring, tracking and control, FAD management options; and advice on FAD marking and monitoring for WCPO-wide application. It was noted that the working group’s webpage on the Commission website went live in March 2015 and included over 20 documents. The meeting record was taken as read and the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair highlighted the working group’s recommendations, noting that the intent of the November meeting was mainly to address the first two terms of reference but that it also began to address other terms of reference. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair thanked the Marshall Islands Marine Resource Authority and the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council for hosting the August 2015 Majuro workshop on options to help improve WCPFC bigeye conservation and management, and Australia for funding his attendance. This meeting had highlighted that WCPFC did not have a research plan for FAD work. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair noted that the main recommendations from the 27-28 November meeting report were for a research plan to be drafted, and for the Secretariat to conduct two consultancies – to produce a report on options and considerations for marking and identification of FADs to be deployed and, associated with the research plan, to produce proposed draft data fields to be reported by vessel operators, with both for consideration by SC12 and TCC12."
WCPFC12,582,The Commission Chair noted that a key consideration along with the recommendations was whether the working group should continue.
WCPFC12,583,EU saw the FADMgmtOptions-IWG discussions as useful to inform future work. EU supported the consultancy on FAD Marking and Identification but questioned the need for a feasibility study related to data fields. The work was a priority and needed to be in the budget being decided during WCPFC12. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)79  EU noted that similar work was taking place in other RFMOs and it was important to enhance dialogue with them on cross-cutting issues. This CCM supported holding the next meeting back to back with another meeting to reduce costs.
WCPFC12,584,The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair advised that he was waiting for the Commission to make the decision on the consultancies before going out to the consultants for cost estimates; the work related to data fields would be a desktop analysis with initial inputs from the SPC-OFP/Secretariat so the costs should not be overly large.
WCPFC12,585,"USA agreed that this was important work and supported the working group continuing. This CCM further agreed that consideration of how to leverage the work other tuna RFMOs was important, noting that while WCPFC was unique in many ways, on FADs there were similarities. USA asked that a preliminary or rough cost be provided for the FAC’s consideration during WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,586,"PNA members noted that they will implement a trial FAD tracking and registration programme in 2016 to meet a range of scientific, compliance and management purposes, and FAD charging, intended to serve as an incentive to fish on free schools and reduce FAD use as well as replace the FAD closure in order to remove the disproportionate burden transferred onto SIDS. PNA members prioritised improved understanding of the impact of FAD fishing on target stocks, and supported development of a research plan for FADs to address the economic costs of the management actions. They supported the production of a report on FAD marking and identification, and recommendations for improving the collection and reporting of data on FADs. These members supported the transfer of responsibility for provision of certain FAD data from observers to vessel operators."
WCPFC12,587,"Japan commented that its priority for the research plan would be to understand how the purse-seine catch of bigeye tuna could be reduced, noting research presented to SC11 showing that 9-14 vessels were responsible for 25% of the bigeye tuna purse-seine catches in 2010-2013 (Paragraph 468 of the SC11 Summary Report)."
WCPFC12,588,"EU took up Japan’s point, about the importance of research on areas where higher concentration of catches of bigeye tuna are caught, noting that a project integrating a range of purse seine data in order to better understand eventually contribute in reducing the impact of the purse seine fishery on bigeye tuna will soon be undertaken by SPC, funded with the EU voluntary contribution for 2015.  This project could support the development of potential measures to reduce interactions with bigeye tuna in the purse seine fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.  The EU considered that this study focusses on one of the priorities of the Commission.  ."
WCPFC12,589,"Korea generally supported the direction of the working group. Regarding the research plan, Korea felt that the working group should focus on improving current FAD management rather than exploring new technologies and systems. Korea commented that the working group should cooperate with SC more actively, and emphasised the importance of taking relevant data confidentiality issues into account. This CCM asked for the meeting documents to be prepared well in advance of the next FADMgmtOptions-IWG meeting to enable active engagement by all CCMs in its work."
WCPFC12,590,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, Birdlife, Greenpeace, ISSF and WWF, Pew noted the FADMgmtOptions-IWG’s draft schedule for discussing management options, but urged members to progress the work comprehensively and as a matter of priority. These observer organizations supported designing a research agenda on FADs and exploring a marking scheme, noting that sufficient data is already available. Pew and WWF noted their paper summarizing current information on management options; it highlighted that options that directly manage bigeye held the most promise for reducing mortality. Pew estimated that approximately 120,000 FADs were deployed annually across all oceans and WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)80  their use was increasing, which underlines the importance of addressing the management implications of FADs. These organizations saw supporting the FADMgmtOptions-IWG as important, to ensure it could effectively explore and recommend management options for the purse-seine fishery."
WCPFC12,591,"Japan commented that FAD management was important for reduction of purse seine bigeye catch and the FADMgmtOptions-IWG should address it with its planned tasks.  Japan brought to the Commission’s attention issues relating to the definition of a FAD as outlined in CMM 2009-02; para. 3 which stipulates any object or group of objects, of ‘any size’.  Japan expressed the view that if this definition is applied as it is without consideration of the real situation on board a vessel, it was possible that an observer might judge that a set had been conducted within one nautical mile of a FAD by a piece of plastic or wood chopstick found in the net although the fishing master had not intended to conduct a FAD set.  During the FAD closure period there is a risk that the operation was judged as illegal even if the fishing master did not notice small materials and unintentionally circled them.  This CCM considered this to be one of the most problematic FAD-related issues and expressed the view that this needs to be reviewed.  Japan emphasized the importance of development of a framework to address this issue and noted its intention to propose a draft to the next TCC or other opportunities.  ."
WCPFC12,592,The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair noted that this issue would be taken into account during discussions on FAD management.
WCPFC12,593,"The Commission adopted the report of the first meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG, held 27-28 November 2015 (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2), and the work plan (Attachment V)."
WCPFC12,594,"The Commission agreed that a consultancy should be undertaken early in 2016 to produce a report on options and considerations for Marking and Identification of FADs to be deployed, for consideration at SC12 and TCC12. The consultancy should be based on the draft prospectus (Attachment V) and among other things take into consideration electronic signature and physical marking aspects from the 2016 PNA trial tracking programme and that used in other tuna RFMOs. The consultancy should also provide advice on the feasibility of options of physical marking of the buoy, physical marking of the buoy and the FAD attachment, and electronic identification, along with the costs and benefits of each option. The consultancy should also take into account Attachment E to the report of the first meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Report (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2)."
WCPFC12,595,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat and Scientific Services Provider to work with the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair and Vice-Chair to further develop the draft outline of a research plan in 2016, based on Attachment D of the report of the first meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2). The draft research plan should be for consideration and input by SC12 and TCC12 before submission to WCPFC13. The draft plan should incorporate some consideration of costs and benefits of various research and data collection activities to assist with prioritizing the work. Consideration should also be given within the plan to addressing both target and non-target species."
WCPFC12,596,"The Commission agreed that vessel operators should provide data on FADs covering the following two major areas:           a. FAD design and construction of FAD to be deployed or encountered (materials, electronics, size etc)            b. FAD activity (deploying, retrieving, setting, visiting, loss etc).   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)81"
WCPFC12,597,The Commission noted that the FADMgmtOptions-IWG recommendations that:                 (i) the FAD data fields to be reported by vessel operators should be based on the WCPFC ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields and the data fields collected by other RFMOs;               (ii) data collected by observers on FADs can be used for verification of FAD activities of vessels;              (iii) the FAD data should be provided to the Commission via flag State electronically using appropriate systems such as FAD e-logbooks or information systems such as PNA iFIMS etc.
WCPFC12,598,"The Commission agreed that a consultancy be undertaken in early 2016, tasked with producing proposed draft data fields to be reported by vessel operators for consideration at SC12 and TCC12."
WCPFC12,599,The Commission agreed that the FADMgmtOptions-IWG should continue in 2016. 12.6 Harvest Strategy Workshop (MOW)
WCPFC12,600,"Ian Cartwright presented the report of the Harvest Strategy Workshop (HSW), previously named the Management Objectives Workshop (MOW), which was held just prior to WCPFC12 (WCPFC12-2015-23). The HSW was the fourth in a series of informal workshops convened by the Commission to facilitate and support the development of harvest strategies by the Commission. The focus of these workshops had been on capacity building, awareness raising and identification and discussion of a broad range of objectives for key fisheries. The workshop has partly changed emphasis and focused on options to advance the harvest strategy approach and discussion of draft CMMs as well. The workshop had provided an opportunity for the fisheries managers of all CCMs to exchange views on key management issues. Some discussion points included: that context was important in making comparisons (e.g. Atlantic albacore vs. southern bluefin tuna); there were variations between RFMOs including assumptions on stock-recruitment relationships, risk levels, LRPs; capacity building and engagement important; risk levels have slipped through the cracks; it is advantageous for allocation to have been decided in advance of developing a harvest strategy but it was not an essential prerequisite. Cartwright thanked ABNJ and the EU for the funding provided for this workshop."
WCPFC12,601,A lengthy discussion took place as members considered whether to hold another workshop.
WCPFC12,602,"PNA members considered that the meeting provided a good basis for developing a harvest control rule for skipjack, but broadly these CCMs took the view that the value of the workshops had declined as discussions shifted from general approaches to more specific issues on which decisions need to be taken. These CCMs commented that the SC management issues theme was a forum to discuss reference points and harvest control rules, and was the appropriate place for the Commission’s work on harvest strategies."
WCPFC12,603,"EU expressed the view that the MOW/HSW should continue, representing real added value. EU saw it as an important step between SC and the Commission discussions, as it operationalised the science."
WCPFC12,604,"Australia saw value in the workshop, or a forum like the workshop, to think about and discuss the scientific findings and their implications for management arrangements outside the Commission setting. This CCM stated that, with the harvest strategies work being undertaken, the workshop represented a valuable forum, but noted PNA members’ comments and agreed that there could be benefit to holding a workshop of this kind earlier in the commission process to enable time for development of proposal following discussions. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)82"
WCPFC12,605,"Palau stated that the skipjack outcomes provided a basis for work by SPC to be presented to the next SC meeting and supported PNA’s view on the way ahead, reiterating that PNA members considered the annual workshops, held before Commission meetings, to have served their purpose, preferring work to be integrated into the work of the SC, TCC and Commission."
WCPFC12,606,"New Zealand noted the usefulness of the workshop, but agreed with the need to change the structure to bring a level of formality to it. Noting PNA’s comments, this CCM suggested integrating the HSW with the SC, to formalise a component of the work and recommendations. The Commission could instruct SC to reorganise to allow fisheries managers to attend. However, New Zealand also noted that the HSW/MOW provide an opportunity for free and frank exchange without the formality of SC."
WCPFC12,607,"EU noted that it would go with consensus on a compromise, and noted that the dialogue between scientists and managers is increasing in other RFMOs. EU considered that SC already does some of this work and will continue to do so in its intensive week of discussions each year, and this work assists the development of the Commission harvest strategies."
WCPFC12,608,"The Chair noted the support for continuation of the dialogue but not to have another workshop in the way it had been done previously, and the ABNJ project could support these discussions. The Chair noted that having the discussion at SC would mean that SC would need to also include managers, and there may be budget implications if managers were to add SC to their workload."
WCPFC12,609,"USA expressed the view that formality could be added to the workshops and thought it would not be practical for the managers to attend SC; SC’s role should be limited to evaluation. USA commented that SC could do more, coupled with a separate and informal meeting of managers, and that the workshop could be cut down by one day and held prior to the Commission meeting."
WCPFC12,610,"EU supported the USA proposal, agreeing that the role of SC and managers should be separated and that it was impractical for managers to attend SC."
WCPFC12,611,"RMI reiterated its earlier comment, supporting the work’s integration into SC and TCC. This CCM noted that it was difficult for small administrations to participate meaningfully in additional meetings and it was disruptive to have the workshop just before the Commission meeting."
WCPFC12,612,"Japan supported the USA’s suggestion, stating that this work required the participation of decision-makers and they may not necessarily go to SC. Japan supported the discussions taking place around the Commission meeting, and the Commission should have it on the agenda, to discuss species by species. China supported this view."
WCPFC12,613,"PNG supported RMI’s view, and noted that SC and TCC were subsidiary bodies whose discussions and recommendations are forwarded to the managers on which to take decisions."
WCPFC12,614,"The Cook Islands noted its experience was to separate participation at meetings, commenting that a meeting of managers to make the necessary commitments was important and a one day workshop prior to the Commission meeting was a worthy investment."
WCPFC12,615,EU reiterated its preferred option but supported Japan’s suggestion as a compromise.
WCPFC12,616,"Tokelau reiterated PNA members’ position. This CCM noted that several delegations did not send senior managers to the workshop this year but instead came to the Commission meeting with a set of positions that rendered efforts in the workshop useless. PNA members preferred, as a compromise, a one-day workshop after SC. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)83"
WCPFC12,617,"The Chair noted the lack of agreement, and suggested that no HSW/MOW be held in 2016 and instead the Commission continues these discussions, along with SC. There were no objections to this. The Chair expressed thanks to Cartwright for his work over four years."
WCPFC12,618,"The Commission agreed that there will not be a Management Objectives Workshop/Harvest Strategy Workshop in 2016, and the harvest strategy-related issues will be included on the WCPFC13 agenda in 2016. In addition, the Commission directed SC12 to include these discussions under the Management Issues theme agenda item, so that the discussion on harvest strategies, in particular, continues."
WCPFC12,619,The Commission adopted the report of the Harvest Strategy Workshop (WCPFC12-2015-23) and thanked Ian Cartwright for his work leading the MOW and HSW for the last four years. AGENDA ITEM 13 – ADOPTION OF FINAL COMPLIANCE MONITORING REPORT
WCPFC12,620,"The TCC Vice-Chair, presented the draft of the final CMS (as attached to the Summary Report of the TCC Special Session, WCPFC12-2015-19e), noting the cooperation and compromises that members had made in its compilation."
WCPFC12,621,Tokelau and Samoa sought clarification about their compliance status on an obligation relating to reporting on coastal state purse-seine limits under CMM 2014-07.
WCPFC12,622,The Compliance Manager explained that the reports had been received but the compliance issue that was noted related to a missed the Annual Report Part 2 deadline.
WCPFC12,623,"New Zealand made a general observation about the lengthy list of CCMs in the non-compliant category. It was noted that it included a wide range of non-compliance – for example, late reporting was in the same category as more severe compliance problems. This CCM commented that it was looking at the way these are differentiated as the Compliance Monitoring Scheme develops."
WCPFC12,624,"EU added to New Zealand’s comment, noting that the category is general, listing the country but not identifying the non-compliance. This CCM noted the tier scoring system used for data provision, which gives a non-compliance rating, and suggested a tier scoring might be explored to quantify the level of non-compliance in general."
WCPFC12,625,Philippines raised the idea of a rating system which gave a percentage to a CCM’s compliance.
WCPFC12,626,"The Chair reminded CCMs that the Final CMR is made up of the executive summary and two tables which each provide much detail and, taken together, form the background of the categorisations. The Chair noted the compliance monitoring measure was in development during this meeting and encouraged members to continue their work. The Chair thanked the TCC Vice-Chair for her efforts in preparing the final CMR."
WCPFC12,627,The Commission adopted the 2015 Final Compliance Monitoring Report. (Attachment W)   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)84  AGENDA ITEM 14 – ADOPTION OF 2016 IUU VESSEL LIST
WCPFC12,628,The Commission considered the WCPFC 2016 IUU Vessel List for adoption. The Chair noted that one provisional vessel listing had not been resolved during initial discussions on the first day of the meeting and sought an update from Fiji on the issue of the FAIMANU V.
WCPFC12,629,"Fiji advised the Commission that after receiving notification from the authorities in Wallis and Futuna, through France, Fiji was satisfied with the sanctions imposed on the vessel owners, which it considered a deterrent to others. Fiji further advised that it did not wish to pursue the matter further and recommended the withdrawal of FAIMANU V from the Provisional WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC12,630,"Acknowledging Fiji’s statement, France expressed its gratitude to Fiji for the time and effort it had dedicated to the matter."
WCPFC12,631,"The Chair commented that as a result of that satisfactory resolution, there were no new nominations for the 2016 WCPFC IUU Vessel List. It was noted, however, that three vessels were currently on the list and the Secretariat was asked to provide any updates."
WCPFC12,632,"The Compliance Manager noted that a reply from Georgia had been received during WCPFC12, to a letter the Executive Director had sent post-TCC11. In this letter, Georgia had confirmed that the vessels NEPTUNE and FU LIEN No. 1 were no longer flagged to Georgia."
WCPFC12,633,"The Chair suggested that this be reflected in the final version of WCPFC IUU Vessel List, noting that it is not known what flag these vessels are currently flying. The ‘Current flag (previous flags)’ column of the list would read ‘unknown’ followed by ‘Georgia’."
WCPFC12,634,"EU noted that TCC11 had recommended seeking information from other RFMOs about vessels which had been on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for a long time. To give the issue more visibility, this CCM suggested a footnote reflecting this could be included into the list."
WCPFC12,635,The Commission adopted the 2016 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment X).
WCPFC12,636,"Australia expressed appreciation to those countries that cooperate in the area of surveillance and enforcement, particularly in relation to data sharing, noting that these activities underpin WCPFC’s management measures. Enforcement activities are costly, and sharing resources are necessary to ensure cost effective activities. This CCM encouraged countries to continue to share data and work cooperatively to respond to alleged IUU incidents in a manner that prevents them happening in the future, observing that IUU activities undermine the sustainability of stocks."
WCPFC12,637,"FSM supported Australia’s observation, advising that FSM continues to experience infractions of its Fisheries Act, including violations of territorial waters, by some members and CNMs. FSM noted that the Convention is clear on the need to combat IUU in all its forms, and called on members and CNMs to meet their flag state obligations. This CCM observed that MCS activities are a significant cost and called on Vietnam to meet the expectations of it as a CNM."
WCPFC12,638,"Vietnam advised the Commission that it had taken steps to resolve the issue referred to by FSM. On receipt of information about small boats entering FSM waters, a letter was sent from the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the FSM Embassy in Beijing. While the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received information from the FSM authorities, Vietnam expressed to the Commission its strong commitment to resolving the issue. Vietnam assured the Commission and FSM that these small boats are considered to have violated both FSM and Vietnam’s laws and will be punished. Vietnam WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)85  nevertheless wants to point out that the small boats did not catch tuna, tuna-like or shark species, which precludes their listing on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. AGENDA ITEM 15 – ADOPTION OF NEW PROPOSALS"
WCPFC12,639,The Commission considered for adoption new proposals that were not addressed under species-specific agenda items. FFA proposal for Workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06
WCPFC12,640,"On 8 December, Australia reported back on discussions through the week on WCPFC12-2015-DP09. Australia had received comments and had posted a revised draft of the harvest strategies work plan. The draft included an opening statement that describes the logic behind the plan and includes the revised timeline and levels of risk. Australia proposed that issues not agreed at WCPFC12 would be pushed into 2016, but otherwise remained unchanged."
WCPFC12,641,"The EU noted that it was important that this work was pursued, commenting that WCPFC is entering pioneering field, ahead of many RFMOs, by adopting harvest strategies. EU preferred to have started with stocks that are more compromised, such as BET, but accepted that this was a step-by-step process. It was noted that EU had contributed financially to this work and supported adoption of the work plan. This CCM expressed a preference that the target for the rebuilding plan for bigeye tuna was to rebuild the stock above BMSY in line with the objectives of the current tropical tuna measure. It also indicated that in particular in the absence of agreed TRP and in line with the Convention, the LRP should not be BMSY."
WCPFC12,642,"Indonesia supported the work plan, and stated that when Indonesia ratified the WCPFC Convention in 2013 it also attached a declaration that the Convention area did not cover certain Indonesian waters, noting that archipelagic waters play an important role in Indonesian fisheries – 320,000 tonnes of tuna is taken from these waters. Indonesia seeks to ensure measures within these waters are compatible with WCPFC measures, and understand this is their obligation under UNCLOS and the FSA. The WPEA project and other organisations had assisted the development of high seas fisheries for yellowfin and skipjack, with a plan to finish this work by 2017."
WCPFC12,643,"China noted that some difficulties remained with the draft and the new approach, noting that they needed time to adapt."
WCPFC12,644,"Japan commented that the work plan should make it clear what point is agreed or not agreed, noting that the TRP for skipjack had been agreed but not yellowfin, or acceptable levels of risk, and work was being pushed into the next year. Japan suggested more flexible tables."
WCPFC12,645,The Chair noted that the work plan was subject to decisions being taken by the Commission and if the Commission could not make those decisions then those issues would simply be moved to next year.
WCPFC12,646,"New Zealand supported the work plan and the concepts behind it, and noted that the Commission was still working on a measure looking at a yellowfin tuna interim risk level which would allow the science to continue apace, based on the structure in the work plan."
WCPFC12,647,"Australia supported 10% acceptable level of risk, on an interim basis. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)86"
WCPFC12,648,"EU supported this acceptable level of risk, and noted, regarding Japan and China’s concerns, that the Commission was agreeing a process with the work plan, which was a living doc, with some elements not yet perfect. This CCM reminded the Commission that the importance of the HSW/MOW was as a forum to discuss some of these details."
WCPFC12,649,"Japan noted that the Commission had agreed a skipjack TRP and a task to SC for the bigeye tuna rebuilding plan, but acceptable levels of risk for yellowfin and skipjack was not yet agreed or the management objectives for skipjack. This CCM noted that it was not ready to adopt the table as proposed, asking for more substantial discussion on each item to decide meaningful and effective ones. Japan was not optimistic that the work plan was flexible, noting that once it was decided it would have a serious impact on the fisheries."
WCPFC12,650,"USA supported the adoption of the work plan, noting that a significant amount of work had gone into the work plan and, as EU had stated, it was a living document. The dates were flexible as were other aspects, allowing the Commission to continue developing the harvest strategies."
WCPFC12,651,"Australia referred to CMM 2014-06 adopted last year which describes the elements these discussions were working towards. This CCM explained that the work plan was a practical tool to set out the work which the Commission agreed to do in that CMM. The work plan was not intended to lock anything in, in a permanent way, or bind the Commission to certain dates. Rather, it was supposed to reflect a genuine endeavour to tackle the work. Australia noted that the way the work plan was drafted reflects the language in CMM 2014-06, and the substantive elements that go towards the Commission harvest strategies are decided separately to the work plan, which was simply a plan. Australia reiterated that the work plan was flexible and elements can be shuffled around if necessary; it included language to provide comfort around these issues."
WCPFC12,652,"New Zealand noted that there was no advance in the discussion around risk levels, and advised that it had been working with interested members to consider a proposal for interim risk level for yellowfin tuna and proposed to circulate some suggested text to advance the science process.  This was subsequently circulated as WCPFC12-2015-DP27, but was not further discussed."
WCPFC12,653,The Chair asked for an update on the recording of management objectives for skipjack and albacore.
WCPFC12,654,"In response to further concerns from China, the Chair noted that WCPFC12-2015-DP09 was just a plan, and it was flexible. The Chair asked if the Commission could agree to the draft, noting that what was not agreed at this meeting will simply be moved to 2016. The Chair preferred to not have substantive discussions on the actual elements at this stage, just that the draft workplan be adopted and certain elements be moved forward to 2016."
WCPFC12,655,"Japan and China supported this, with Japan reiterating matters the Commission could not agree at WCPFC12 should be deferred to 2016."
WCPFC12,656,"The Chair thanked Australia for its hard work in advancing this difficult work through the Commission, noting that the Commission had a lot on its plate for 2016."
WCPFC12,657,The Commission adopted the workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment Y). The Commission tasked the SC with support from the Scientific Service Provider to undertake the activities specified in the agreed workplan.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)87  FFA proposal for management of enclosed and semi-enclosed high seas areas
WCPFC12,658,"FFA members reported on progress on WCPFC12-2015-DP05, a proposal for additional MCS measures for certain high seas areas. Consultations had been held with some delegations, and there were some red lines on this proposal as well as support, subject to various qualifiers such as improving transparency."
WCPFC12,659,The Chair noted that there was not agreement on this proposal.
WCPFC12,660,"New Caledonia made a statement regarding entry to and exit from its EEZ. New Caledonia noted the FFA proposal which aimed to increasing the monitoring of vessels which enter the EEZs of coastal states, and reminded the Commission that at WCPFC7, entry and exit notification for all the EEZs covered by the Convention was proposed. This proposal was not accepted but the WCPFC7 summary report (para. 404) suggested it could be addressed through national legislation. Accordingly, New Caledonia implemented such a provision in 2011 and was currently preparing an amendment to extend reporting fields to the catch on board when the vessel is entering or leaving New Caledonia’s EEZ. New Caledonia stated that it will not hinder the right of transit of any ships under UNCLOS; the measure is taken under Article 73, para. 1 of UNCLOS to ensure compliance with a coastal state’s fisheries regulations; it brings consistency between the requirements of licensed vessels to provide detailed information and non-licensed vessels. This CCM noted that the entry/exit declaration for its EEZ is not optional, and not making one is a severe infringement; catch on board may be regarded as having been caught in the New Caledonia EEZ. New Caledonia reminded the Commission of the creation in 2014 of the Natural Park of the Coral Sea, which covers the whole EEZ and, consequently, waters within the Convention area. This CCM noted that a management plan for this park was in development and wished to build it in cooperation with its neighbours.  FFA proposal for enhanced port-based MCS measures"
WCPFC12,661,"FFA members reported on their proposal in WCPFC12-2015-DP10, relating to port-based MCS measures. After consultations in the margins of this meeting, and despite support from several CCMs and observer organizations, FFA members reported that one CCM’s position meant the proposal was unable to progress. These members will continue to develop port state measures within the FFA framework, and FFA asked that CCMs consult with them on elements which need to be changed."
WCPFC12,662,"EU noted that it would have preferred to move towards FAO standards but commended FFA’s efforts this year and supported their proposal. This CCM saw this proposal as the first step in the right direction towards FAO standards. This CCM expressed disappointment that for the third year in a row a proposal for port state measures was not adopted, and hoped the Commission would do so as soon as possible."
WCPFC12,663,USA noted that port inspection measures are important to ensure sustainability because they help ensure that seafood entering the market has not been illegally harvested. This CCM hoped the Commission will progress next year on this important issue.
WCPFC12,664,"Japan noted that it had stated its position for the last two year on the FAO Port State Measures Agreement, and commented that domestic discussions were still underway on this issue. In relation to the proposal, Japan noted that it had contacted FFA and discussed it in detail, including the intention of some of the provisions of the draft proposal in the margin of the meeting. This CCM considered that some areas needed further clarification, exchanges of information and views, and further internal review. Therefore this CCM had not been able to accept this proposal at WCPFC12. Japan was happy to discuss a new proposal along the same lines as the CCSBT scheme adopted at the last CCSBT meeting. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)88"
WCPFC12,665,"Korea noted that port state measures play a part in the fight against IUU fishing, as a gatekeeper preventing IUU catch flowing into the market and the FFA proposal was welcome in this regard. Korea noted that it participates in port state measures through various channels and port-based inspections that are more stringent than the FAO Port State Measures Agreement. Korea stated that it was ready to make a meaningful contribution to the introduction of port state measures which take into account the needs of SIDS."
WCPFC12,666,"Pew, Humane Society International, WWF and Greenpeace expressed their disappointment and noted that this was the sixth Commission meeting at which port state measures has been considered for adoption. These organizations noted that WCPFC remains one of the RFMOs lacking a minimum scheme of port controls, and commented that port state measures are one of the most effective tools to prevent the entry of illegally-caught fish into the world’s markets and a measure would significantly strengthen WCPFC’s management regime. These organizations urged members to take the necessary steps to ensure adoption of minimum standards for port inspections is not delayed further and can be adopted at WCPFC13."
WCPFC12,667,"Chinese Taipei generally supported the proposal, but noted that some members have difficulties due to domestic issues, which it encouraged to resolve as soon as possible and come back next year and reach an agreement."
WCPFC12,668,The Chair noted the general support to have a port state measure in place and strongly encouraged those members with difficulties to make progress next year. USA proposed revisions to VMS SSPs related to ALC type approval
WCPFC12,669,"On 5 December, the USA advised that there was a new version of the VMS SSPs proposal posted shortly (WCPFC12-2015-DP13_rev1). USA briefly highlighted some changes which had been made to the initial proposal during negotiations in the margins of WCPFC12. The approval/disapproval process was no longer solely a Secretariat function, there were now roles for TCC and the Commission. And if an ALC type is removed, flag states will have a two-year window to change to approved types."
WCPFC12,670,"Japan noted TCC’s concern about at least 41 vessels that were not reporting to the Commission VMS and agreed that it needed to be addressed, but took the view that the replacement should be when the unit would naturally be replaced, as new ALCs are very expensive, which is large financial burden for fishermen, especially small-scale fishermen despite there was no fault of them."
WCPFC12,671,"EU preferred a one year replacement window and thought this was feasible. EU supported USA’s changes, noting that without the timeframe a lot of the meaning behind the amendment is lost."
WCPFC12,672,"FFA members thanked USA for working intersessionally on the proposal and supported the revisions, noting that they would strengthen the WCPFC ALC approval process and enable the Secretariat to remove ALC makes and models that no longer meet the minimum standards of the Commission VMS from the approved list."
WCPFC12,673,"Australia supported the USA proposal. Australia understood Japan’s position and recognised the need to give fleets time. This CCM had no practical concerns with the delay in implementation, however Australia urged Japan to consider a timeframe."
WCPFC12,674,A lengthy discussion took place around a timeframe. Japan reiterated its preference for the units to be replaced when the next installation of the unit takes place but was able to be flexible on a 5 year timeframe. Some CCMs wanted the timeframe to be no later than one or two years. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)89
WCPFC12,675,Japan and the USA agreed to discuss the timeframe in the margins. The agenda item remained open.
WCPFC12,676,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, HSI, WWF, Greenpeace, SFP and ISSF, Pew thanked USA but expressed concern and disappointment at the lack of consensus on the timeframe for replacing non-type approved ALCs, as it represents an important standard for enhancing the VMS SSPs. These organizations noted that VMS was critically important for vessel monitoring in high seas areas within the Convention area but stated that the VMS CMM and SSPs needed to be improved, particularly around manual reporting. These organizations noted that manual reporting was established to provide vessels with a backup means of position reporting, but commented that it allows vessels to stay out at sea, unmonitored, for up to 45 days, especially if there is no observer onboard. The Secretariat’s 2014 VMS annual report indicates that 100 fishing and carrier vessels provided 2,044 manual reports in the first eight months of 2014, on the basis that their VMS unit malfunctioned or failed. Assuming a reporting rate of every 6 hours, those manual reports amounted to roughly 511 days of vessel time. With fisheries observer coverage for some longline fleets falling short of the 5% coverage, these organizations noted that this vessel time is almost completely unverifiable. It was observed that the FFA type approval process for VMS units has ensured the phasing out of problematic VMS units for vessels on the FFA Vessel Register, curbing high levels of manual reporting by these vessels. These organizations commented that the Commission should move towards establishing similar standards to limit manual reporting and assist in ensuring verifiability. They encouraged CCMs to adopt the USA proposal and to seek to improve the VMS CMM and SSPs going forward, particularly by reducing the time during which vessels are authorized to manually report when the VMS unit has malfunctioned or is inoperable."
WCPFC12,677,"Later in the meeting, further discussions on this issue took place, with two changes: a change of wording from ‘ALC’ to ‘instrument’ and, more substantively, a proposal for the replacement period of non-approved ALCs of ‘no more than three years’."
WCPFC12,678,The Commission agreed to the amendments to the VMS SSPs related to ALC-type approval procedures (Attachment Z) Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) CMM
WCPFC12,679,"On 5 December 2015 the TCC Vice-Chair reported that the CMS measure SWG had discussed the amendments and required a further meeting. On 7 December, another meeting took place with interested participants with a view to agreeing a draft for CCMs to consider."
WCPFC12,680,"On 8 December, the TCC Vice-Chair reported to plenary that parties had made compromises and WCPFC12-2015-20_rev5 was ready for discussions with a view to adoption."
WCPFC12,681,The Chair asked if the Commission was ready to adopt the measure as amended.
WCPFC12,682,"EU noted that it had participated in the intersessional work on the measure and admitted that there was a sense of engaging something without knowing the impacts, given the extensive revisions to the measure, and the inclusion of some very new and untested concepts. This CCM commented that if there was consensus they would not block the adoption of the measure, as it understood its main intent, but expressed its concerns about how CCMs would be able to provide reasons that they cannot be assessed against an obligation because of capacity constraints, and how implementation plans that run for a certain number of years, would be applied in practice. EU noted that these plans should be reviewed by TCC to evaluate progress. However, EU noted that deciding not to assess a CCM against an obligation was an important decision, and the process needs to be tight to avoid possible abuse. This CCM also raised the issue of the possible financial implications of the proposal which are difficult to anticipate.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)90"
WCPFC12,683,"The Chair drew the Commission’s attention to paras. 26 and 27 which were not yet agreed, on the issues of the review panel and review time period."
WCPFC12,684,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted that the majority of the SWG participants were comfortable with the two-year timeframe, noting that there were major changes to the measure. Others wanted the measure to be reviewed in 2018 and revised in 2019."
WCPFC12,685,"USA expressed appreciation to the current and past Chairs and Vice-Chairs of TCC for developing the proposal, noting that the CMS had gone through a series of one-year measures, that there was a need for the measure to be revised and take into account fairness and capacity building, and the need for the measure to develop the Commission’s capacity to comply with the measures that are in place. This CCM noted that the Commission can do all the science and analysis but it is meaningless if the Commission cannot comply with the measures in place. The new measure needs the opportunity to function, to be put in place, to see how it works, how it is implemented, whether it achieves its goals. The USA continued to take the view that the CMS measure should be permanent, though in an attempt to find common ground would agree for the new measure to be in place for three years before being subject to a independent review panel selected by the Executive Director. This CCM took the view that the measure should be in place for at least two years before it is reviewed, so it can be experienced well before an assessment is attempted and before changes are made."
WCPFC12,686,"Australia noted the good progress at this meeting. This CCM noted the time and effort involved in assessing compliance but noted that these were valuable discussions for the Commission and increased understanding.  It further noted the value of the measure in highlighting where improvements can be made to CMMs. This CCM saw value in a measure that went beyond one year, and saw value in a review of the measure."
WCPFC12,687,Japan preferred the measure to be effective for 2016 and 2017 only. This CCM noted the substantial efforts on the draft but commented that the two very new concepts incorporated in the measure have unknown impacts. Japan took the view that the measure should be implemented on an experimental basis of two years only.
WCPFC12,688,"Several CCMs supported a measure that was effective for 2016 and 2017, including New Zealand, noting that TCC11 found that there were substantial process issues – for example, the introduction of observer reports to the process – which proved extremely useful but were new issues."
WCPFC12,689,"USA reiterated that its strong preference was for a permanent measure, and noted that two years was not a compromise, but that it stood alone on this. The USA also suggested that the review be conducted by a group of people which were selected by the Executive Director but with the members helping select that panel."
WCPFC12,690,"The Chair noted that there was general agreement that the measure would apply for 2016 and 2017 only, and the outstanding issue was whether the review would be conducted by an independent panel or whether the mechanism of the review would be left for TCC to determine."
WCPFC12,691,"RMI suggested keeping the review within the purview of TCC, and how TCC determines how to do that is up to TCC."
WCPFC12,692,"After some time for delegations to consult, late on 8 December the Chair asked if any progress had been made on the outstanding issue of the independent review.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)91"
WCPFC12,693,"USA noted that the issue of having an independent review of the measure had been discussed on a number of occasions, including at WCPFC11 and TCC11. This CCM stated that having such a review would help the Commission strengthen the measure, and it should be done after letting the measure work and having data to evaluate. With the lack of consensus so far in the meeting, the USA expressed the view that if a review is not able to be included in the measure itself at WCPFC12, the meeting report should include a commitment by the Commission to conduct a review after it has been allowed to run for a couple of years."
WCPFC12,694,"Given lack of agreement on aspects of the independent review, a lengthy discussion took place regarding the report language on the timing of the review and who would complete the work."
WCPFC12,695,The Commission adopted CMM 2015-07 Conservation and Management Measure for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (Attachment aa)
WCPFC12,696,"Subject to the recommendations from TCC12 (CMM 2015-07, para 40) a review of the CMS will be conducted by an independent panel selected by the Executive Director in consultation with Members at the end of 2017."
WCPFC12,697,"The Chair thanked the TCC Chair and Vice-Chair for their work developing the amended CMS CMM, noting that it was a significant accomplishment for the Commission. Transshipment"
WCPFC12,698,"When plenary reconvened on this issue, RMI noted that efforts had continued from TCC11 and take into consideration work done at the IWG-ROP and the PNA proposal. Given the impracticability issues in para. 34 and concerns about para. 35 (lack of reporting, manual reporting, VMS issues), para. 37 sets out minimum guidelines for certain vessels to tranship in waters under national jurisdiction. This CCM proposed a complete ban on high seas transshipment other than purse-seine vessels as stipulated in para. 34, noting the impracticability of the associated paras. 35 and 37."
WCPFC12,699,"EU reiterated its concerns about the application of the transshipment measure, which is supposed to be an exception not the rule. EU encouraged RMI to count on its full support for a measure next year."
WCPFC12,700,"In response to the Chair's query about whether to consider para. 34 in CMM 2009-06, or tasking TCC to consider it in some way, PNG noted that in 2006, 2007 and 2008 FFA put forward proposals banning transshipment on the high seas, and these proposals are still on the table. These could be a basis for the start of that discussion."
WCPFC12,701,"FFA members noted that after these proposals were not adopted, FFA sought a more collegial approach in 2009 through guidelines that flag states would use to allow some ongoing high seas transhipment where there was no alternative, but opined that flag states have not implemented that compromise in good faith, with a blanket exemptions of most of the high seas fleet and no effort to reduce high seas transhipments. FFA members noted that it was possible for high seas longline vessels to operate without transhipping – for example the EU longline fleet – and requested the review of para. 34 of CMM 2009-06, particularly the criteria for assessing ‘impracticability’, as a means to tighten controls and move more transhipment activities into ports. FFA members requested that analysis of transhipment activities using the VMS Transhipment Analysis Tool be provided in subsequent annual reports. These CCMs expressed support for the timely provision of transhipment information in the annual report on WCPFC high seas transhipment. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)92"
WCPFC12,702,"The Cook Islands noted that in 2010, it established a Special Management Area for the high seas pockets, and since then has called for more stringent management of high seas area including a transshipment ban. This CCM noted that coastal states will think about implementing legislation to address this issue, and noted that the Cook Islands sees the issue as coming under its licence conditions."
WCPFC12,703,"Japan opined that the chapeau part of CMM 2009-06 states that the Commission recognizes that transshipment is a common global practice. Japan stated that it could not go along with a simple request for a high seas transshipment ban. This CCM understood some CCMs’ concerns about IUU activities, and for this reason Japan supported increasing the traceability of the transshipments."
WCPFC12,704,The Chair asked the Commission about further work.
WCPFC12,705,"RMI noted that a draft guideline was prepared a couple of years back but was not adopted. This CCM was firmly of the view that, notwithstanding that transhipping is a global practice, a simple fix is to impose para. 34. RMI commented that it was not asking for amendments, but for implementation of the measure."
WCPFC12,706,"Korea noted that the observers help ensure compliance, commenting that transshipment was a necessary practice, especially for longline vessels, as making them come back to port creates an operational burden. This CCM opined that the Commission needs to strike the balance between compliance, conservation and operational stability."
WCPFC12,707,"The Chair noted that the views are quite clear, and there remains the circular nature of the discussion between the Commission and the TCC, which is not being resolved. The Chair encouraged CCMs to keep the discussions going in the different forums within the Commission and work on ways to bridge the gaps so the Commission can progress next year."
WCPFC12,708,"USA noted the importance of the issue, and the RMI proposal was very constructive."
WCPFC12,709,"FSM supported FFA’s comments and thanked RMI for taking the lead, commenting that these fleets targets one of the stocks that is in trouble."
WCPFC12,710,RMI requested that Legal Adviser advise on para. 34 as a basis for the work going forward.
WCPFC12,711,"The Legal Adviser opined that para. 34 makes it clear that there should be no transshipment except where the CCM has determined that for certain vessels it is impracticable to operate without being able to transship on the high seas. Para. 37 allows for guidelines to be developed and for these to be agreed by TCC and submitted to the Commission. The Legal Advisor noted that no such guidelines have been submitted. Para. 37 noted that the guidelines set out in the rest of the paragraph shall apply in determining the practicability: 1) whether the prohibition of transshipment on the high seas would cause a significant economic hardship, which is to be assessed in terms of the costs that would be incurred and 2) whether the vessel would have to make significant or substantial changes to its historical way of operating. The Legal Advisor opined that this part of para. 37 combined with the language in para. 34 provide a high threshold before a CCM could determine that a ban on high seas transshipment would be impracticable. If a CCM has made such a determination and has notified that to the Secretariat, then the CCM responsible for offloading and receiving shall advise the Commission of the producers of the monitoring of the transshipment and will submit to the Commission a plan outlining what it is doing to encourage the vessel to come to port. In summary, these paragraphs ensure that there is a high threshold and sets out rules about the procedure to be taken in those circumstances. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)93"
WCPFC12,712,"The EU noted that it was clear that the measure as currently drafted gives a possibility to transship at sea as an exception with a very high threshold of criteria to be met to allow the transshipment. TCC heard about the large number of vessels that notified for transhipment, and they were basically all longliners. EU noted that even if it was impractical for its fleet to tranship in port and it has financial implications, they do it so they are the proof that it is feasible. This CCM stated that the measure was clear, and it is the application of the measure that is the problem. EU commented that it would move forward with RMI on this issue."
WCPFC12,713,"RMI noted that the exceptions were discussed extensively at TCC, and there were problems in terms of compliance. The problem with the measure is that it provides for the exemptions."
WCPFC12,714,"USA recalled that the Commission has discussed paras. 34-38 on previous occasions and has impressed upon the Secretariat to do the work that is called for in para. 37 – developing the further guidelines. This CCM stated that it was necessary to do that work so that the USA is assured that its vessels are on the same playing field as others. This CCM commented that if countries have made the notification, arguably they are compliant, but noted the way forward hinged on the Executive Director providing the guidelines."
WCPFC12,715,"China commented that it tries its best to encourage its fleet to go to port to unload product caught on the high seas but it is practically difficult due to operational costs and conflicts between SIDS’ domestic laws and WCPFC laws, especially around shark species, which provide for no harvesting and no transportation of shark products, making its fleet hesitant to go to port. China commented that some SIDS have increased their port costs. In addition, China noted that many SIDS ports do not have facilities for handling deep frozen product. Through joint ventures, China is seeking to improve these facilities, but the Commission needs to understand the practical problems. For these reasons, China stated that it is hard to persuade their ships to tranship in ports, but China will work with RMI to find a solution."
WCPFC12,716,The Chair noted there was some agreement to revive the request to the Executive Director to draft guidelines as per para. 37 for the TCC to consider in 2016.
WCPFC12,717,"Japan also proposed that para. 13 be reviewed and, if possible, revised."
WCPFC12,718,"Noting paragraph 37 of CMM 2009-06, the Commission tasked the Executive Director to prepare draft guidelines for the determination of circumstances where it is impracticable for certain vessels to tranship in port or in waters under national jurisdiction. TCC12 is tasked to consider these guidelines, and amend as necessary, and recommend them to the Commission for adoption in 2016. The Commission agreed that paragraph 13 should be considered as part of this tasking. EU proposal for amendment of Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission."
WCPFC12,719,"EU advised that during discussions several delegations felt that the Commission should hear from the SC on this issue. Consequently, EU commented that it would not be presenting the amendments for adoption but sought to task SC12 with providing advice and recommendations. EU wanted to work intersessionally with interested CCMs then have a discussion at SC and also TCC as one of the main purposes of the changes is to help the TCC to do its work in interpreting some of the obligations. EU advised that it would come to WCPFC13 with a consolidated proposal."
WCPFC12,720,The Chair sought to clarify whether the Commission wanted to task the subsidiary bodies so that the work continues next year.
WCPFC12,721,"EU and USA favoured this suggestion, with Australia supporting the SC’s review. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)94"
WCPFC12,722,"The Commission noted TCC recommendations paragraphs 486–488 which are recommendations from the CMS process to revise the Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission decision, and the corresponding proposal by the European Union (WCPFC12-2015-DP17) (Attachment v)."
WCPFC12,723,The Commission agreed that SC12 should review the elements in Attachment bb and provide advice and recommendations. AGENDA ITEM 16 – REPORT OF THE NINTH FINANCE AND  ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 16.1 Report of the Ninth Finance and Administration Committee
WCPFC12,724,"P. Callaghan (USA) presented the recommendations included in the report of the Ninth Session of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC9), which was convened by Co-Chairs J. Samuelu Ah-Leong (Samoa) and P. Callaghan (USA) (WCPFC12-2015-24). FAC9 met on 2, 5, 7 and 8 December 2015, during WCPFC12. It was noted that one issue remained unresolved in the budget, referred to in para. 66 of the FAC9 report, relating to funding for Project 67 on skipjack range contraction. A minority at FAC9 did not support keeping it in the budget as they were concerned about getting value out of the USD40,000 allocated, particularly when the details of the work remained unclear."
WCPFC12,725,The Chair thanked Samuelu Ah-Leong and Callaghan for their leadership through a difficult FAC meeting.
WCPFC12,726,"Japan commented that range contraction and local depletion issues were very difficult for island communities, including Japan and those in the Pacific. This CCM noted there is a reason for SC tasked to refer to range contraction and local depletion issues after adoption of the initial TRP of skipjack tuna, and hoped the project would be retained in the budget."
WCPFC12,727,"WWF gave a statement on behalf of ISSF, WWF, the Pew Charitable Trusts and Humane Society International as organisations which participate in the work of the Commission and represent stakeholders ranging from civil society to consumers. These observer organizations commented that, in principle, they were not opposed to a study about the costs of participation in the Commission or to making a reasonable contribution to support their participation. However, if observer organisations are to be required to pay a fee toward the meeting costs, these organizations expect that their participation will not be unduly constrained, including their participation in all meetings and access to all materials in accordance with Article 21 of the WCPF Convention and the Rules of Procedure. These organizations strongly encouraged the review to be undertaken in consultation with observers and recommended the following be considered: the purpose for charging observers a participation fee, ways to account for the participation of observer organizations with smaller and/or differing resource capacities, other options for addressing concerns about the Commission budget, the fees charged in other tuna RFMOs, and ways to strengthen the participation and contributions of observers across the full spectrum of Commission work. 16.2 Budget approval for 2016 and indicative budgets for 2017 and 2018"
WCPFC12,728,"The Commission considered for adoption the WCPFC budget for 2016 and indicative budgets for 2017 and 2018, as submitted by Finance and Administration Committee, which met during WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,729,"The Commission adopted the Report of the Ninth Session of the FAC (WCPFC12-2015-24, Attachment cc) and an eventual Commission budget for 2016 of 7,731,994 USD (Attachment dd). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)95  AGENDA ITEM 17 – ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 17.1 Strategic Plan"
WCPFC12,730,"The Executive Director presented a formal submission to review the current planning framework of the Commission and the Secretariat and to develop a planning framework that includes a long term, high level strategic plan, a shorter-term corporate (or business) plan and the annual work programme (WCPFC12-2015-25). The current strategic plan, adopted in 2010 at WCPF7, covered the period 2011-2013. In 2013, at WCPFC10, the Secretariat tabled an updated Strategic Plan 2014-2016 (which also incorporated the work plans developed at SC9 and TCC9), but views were mixed, with some CCMs considering the plan as more of a short term business plan rather than a forward looking vision for the Commission’s aspirations on the status of stocks and the flow of fisheries benefits. The Secretariat was directed to re-table it in Apia, Samoa for WCPFC11’s consideration, however there was no discussion on it. The current planning framework consists of a strategic plan of 3 year duration and an annual work plan which are not aligned. The Executive Director proposed for a review of the planning framework and to develop the planning documentation that set high-level strategic objectives for the Commission and clearly demarcate the roles of the Commission and those of Secretariat. The Executive Director mentioned that there will be opportunities for members to provide input to the planning documents as the process proposed to develop those plans are is transparent and consultative. A draft terms of reference attached to the working paper contains timelines and key tasks to be undertaken, budget implications, and a tasking to report back to WCPFC13. A budget of $69,500 is estimated to cover the costs expected in the TOR which includes a consultant to facilitate the process and travel costs, and the cost of holding a two day meeting in conjunction with TCC. WCPFC12 was invited to approve the review of the Commission’s planning framework and the development of a new Strategic Plan and a new Corporate Plan in accordance with the terms of reference in Annex 1 of the working paper."
WCPFC12,731,"FFA members welcomed the proposal, noting that it responds to their requests over several years for reform of the Commission’s strategic planning process, to better focus its core business and concentrate attention on certain issues. These CCMs approved the proposed timetable, and invited the consultant, when he or she is appointed, to the annual Forum Fisheries Committee meeting in Vanuatu in May 2016, to facilitate initial consultations with FFA members. FFA hoped a decision on the review and the work to be completed can be made at WCPFC12, so FAC9 can take it into account in the budget."
WCPFC12,732,"Japan noted that the proposal was for a 10-15 year strategy but observed that the Commission discussed the tropical tuna measure for 3 years and the work has not been achieved. Thus, this CCM wondered if the Commission could adopt a 10-15 year plan, which covers everything. Japan further stated that the main issues expected to be included in the plan are already described in the Convention. This CCM questioned the value of budget expenditure for the consultancy and commented that the Commission should work on issues to be really done within limited budget."
WCPFC12,733,PNG noted that separating management from operations was important.
WCPFC12,734,The Commission approved the review of the WCPFC planning framework and the development of a new Strategic Plan and a new Corporate Plan in Attachment dd.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)96  17.2 Research projects 17.2.1 ABNJ Project
WCPFC12,735,"A. Anganuzzi, Global Coordinator of the GEF-funded, FAO-implemented ABNJ (Common Oceans) Tuna Project, provided a report on recent progress under the project (WCPFC12-2015-26). Partners in the project include all of the tuna RFMOs, as well as IGOs, regional organizations, NGOs and the private sector. The first project component relates to strengthening fisheries management including support for meetings on harvest strategies (e.g. the HSW), science-management dialogues, and the ecosystem approach to fisheries. The second project component relates to MCS and reducing IUU fishing. It includes work on MCS best practices and training curricula, in conjunction with FFA, a global database of authorised fishing vessels, legal templates for Port State Measures; electronic monitoring trials (for example in Fiji), and best practices for catch documentation schemes, which were presented at the CDS-IWG in September. The third project component relates to reducing the impacts of tuna fisheries on the ecosystem. The WCPFC is the tuna RFMO focal point for the shark activities under this component, hosting the project’s Technical Coordinator – Sharks and Bycatch (Dr Shelley Clarke) within the Secretariat in Pohnpei. Work under the third component includes collaboration between WCPFC and IATTC on shark data improvement and assessment, enhancing the Bycatch Management Information System, trials to reduce seabird mortality and purse-seine bycatch, and work in the northern Indian Ocean on bycatch in gillnet fisheries. Members’ ongoing participation in, and support for, the ABNJ Tuna Project was gratefully acknowledged."
WCPFC12,736,The Chair thanked Anganuzzi for his presentation and the project’s continued support of the Commission. Interested participants were referred to WCPFC12-2015-26 for more information.
WCPFC12,737,"The FFA Secretariat thanked FAO and the ABNJ project for funding assistance, particularly for MCS training it had facilitated in the region. It was noted that the second MCS Officer Foundation Course had been recently concluded, for which the FAO funding had been very useful. This course provided participants with university qualifications for officers seeking career paths in MCS."
WCPFC12,738,The Commission noted the progress report on the ABNJ project. 17.2.2 WPEA Project
WCPFC12,739,"The WCPFC Science Manager provided an update on the WPEA project (WCPFC12-2015-27), noting that 25% of the WCPFC tuna catch is caught in the WPEA project area. The new GEF funded WPEA Project (Sustainable Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the West Pacific and East Asian Seas) has three components: 1) governance for building regional and national adaptive capacity of Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam in the management of highly migratory stocks, 2) implementation of policy, institutional and fishery management reform, and 3) knowledge sharing. Key activities include data collection (both target and bycatch) from port sampling, landed catch, logbook, VMS, and observer programme and annual tuna catch estimation, capacity building in science, compliance and management, development of specific guidelines on adaptive management and monitoring against the impact of climate change; market-based sustainable harvests through tuna supply chain analysis and eco-labelling and/or certification; development of reference points, harvest strategy and sub-regional stock assessment; and ecosystem approach to fisheries management guiding sustainable harvest of the oceanic tuna stock and reduced by-catch of sea turtles, sharks and seabirds."
WCPFC12,740,The Philippines expressed its appreciation for WCPFC’s assistance and P.Williams (SPC) for helping improving the quality of the data that Philippines provides to the Commission. This CCM agreed that there was a lot of work to be done but noted that the WPEA project helps them perform their duties WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)97  as a Commission member and the capacity building it provides helps the Philippines delegation to actively participate. The Philippines hoped the Commission continues to support the project.
WCPFC12,741,"Echoing this request for support for the project, Indonesia noted the tangible improvements in catch estimates and capacity building it had provided."
WCPFC12,742,"Vietnam express its gratitude to the Commission and to the GEF for the support provided, noting that the project had greatly improved data collection and analysis, with the Commission now receiving higher quality data from Vietnam as a result. This CCM thanked the Science Manager and SPC and hoped for further strengthened support of the Commission."
WCPFC12,743,"FFA members noted that data provision from the fisheries in these countries is poor but their catch is significant.  FFA support the project because these data gaps in the stock assessments impact on the scientific work of the Commission. These CCMs noted that neither Vietnam nor Indonesia has provided, or authorised the release of, their operational- and aggregate-level data to the Commission, and strongly urged them to address this as a matter of priority."
WCPFC12,744,The Commission noted the report on the progress of the WPEA project. 17.3 Election of officers
WCPFC12,745,The Commission appointed Paul Callaghan (USA) to continue as Co-Chair of the FAC.
WCPFC12,746,The Commission appointed Aisake Batibasaga (Fiji) to be Vice-Chair of the Scientific Committee.  17.4 Future meetings
WCPFC12,747,"The Commission agreed that:  • SC12 would be held in from Wednesday 3 – Thursday 11 August 2016 in Bali, Indonesia • NC12 would be held for 5 days on a date to be confirmed in September 2016 in Japan • TCC12 would be held from Wednesday 21 September – Tuesday 27 September 2016 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia.  • WCPFC13 would be held from Monday 5 – Friday 9 December 2016 in Fiji  • FAC10 would be held immediately prior to WCPFC13."
WCPFC12,748,"The Commission also agreed that three intersessional working groups would hold meetings in 2016, as follows:  • CDS-IWG, which would meet immediately prior to TCC12 • FADMgmtOptions-IWG would meet immediately following TCC12 • ERandEM-IWG on dates to be confirmed, preferably prior to SC12.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)98"
WCPFC12,749,"The ERandEM-IWG Chair noted that one set of possible dates which had been discussed with the FFA was for the meeting to be held in March 2016 back-to-back with FFA Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Working Group in Auckland, New Zealand, and that these would be confirmed in due course."
WCPFC12,750,"RMI noted that the growth in size of Commission meetings restricts the venues at which they can be held, and for many Pacific Island countries it was impossible to host a Commission meeting. This CCM congratulated Fiji for hosting WCPFC13. AGENDA ITEM 18 – OTHER MATTERS 18.1 Update on WCPFC VMS"
WCPFC12,751,"The Compliance Manager and the Deputy Director General of the FFA, W. Norris, presented WCPFC12-2015-29, an update on the status of the Commission VMS. The Compliance Manager noted the purpose of the agenda item was to update the Commission on changes to the Commission VMS system which would take place in 2016. The working paper outlined the process which FFA undertook to change its VMS service provider, and the background to this decision including participation by the WCPFC Secretariat in the tender process. The Commission VMS is provided by FFA under a Service Level Agreement. Currently almost 3500 vessels report to the Commission VMS. The cost to the Commission of the system has remained stable in recent years at around $400,000 per annum (para. 9). Other costs include those for airtime services, training and redundancy."
WCPFC12,752,"The Deputy Director General of the FFA advised the Commission about the tender process FFA undertook in 2015 to test the market for alternative VMS providers. This was done for a number of reasons: a) the current VMS provider had been the provider for 5 years and it is good business practice to test the market, b) the cost of the current service provider was seen by FFA as too high and c) FFA were concerned that the VMS technology was not being developed by the current provider at the pace they wanted. The tender review panel, on which the WCPFC Secretariat sat, met three times in 2013-2014. During this time the panel reviewed the expressions of interest and created a shortlist, invited the three shortlisted firms to present and then provided a recommend to the FFA Executive. That went to the decision making body of the FFA, the Forum Fisheries Committee, in May 2015 and FFA received approval to change service providers. The new provider is Trackwell, an Icelandic company which provides VMS services to a number of fisheries agencies. WCPFC has been given formal notice of the change and meetings are planned to assist the technical work of transitioning to the new system and ensure the project plan is in place."
WCPFC12,753,"The Compliance Manager noted that FFA will switch over to the new system a little earlier than WCPFC and the Secretariat is taking steps to make sure that when the Commission switches over, all the boats that can be seen on one system are also seen on the other system. FFA has arranged for services through the current VMS to continue until 30 June 2015 after which WCPFC plans to have transitioned fully to the Trackwell system. Members will receive advice on this. The Compliance Manager referred to the paper noting that the paper includes some indicative costs which would need to be included in the Commission budget under VMS SLA costs to cover the use of two systems for one full quarter (USD$35,000). It was noted that the Secretariat has not yet been advised of the additional costs that are likely to be charged by the airtime service providers for the direct reporting vessels, and an estimate for additional costs is also proposed. The Compliance Manager commented that some members may need assistance with using the new VMS system, so the VMS training budget was proposed to be increased by $20,000. It was noted that Commission staff would be able to conduct the testing of the system in-house WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)99  for no additional cost to the Commission. Finally the Compliance Manager noted that the Secretariat would keep Commission members updated over the next six months."
WCPFC12,754,Australia was glad to see the work going ahead and the Secretariat taking steps to maintain the service. It was noted that some time ago the Secretariat had raised the idea of having extra staff for this work.
WCPFC12,755,"The Compliance Manager confirmed there was no formal proposal to increase the number of VMS staff, but as was noted by the Executive Director earlier in the meeting the Secretariat was giving consideration to formally recruiting the IT Network Administrator position. This would allow the Commission IT Manager to focus more of his time during the first half of the year to working alongside the WCPFC VMS Manager and FFA VMS staff on implementing and testing the new VMS system and ensuring current IMS and website linkages are unaffected."
WCPFC12,756,Chinese Taipei requested the Secretariat to provide additional information including the budget implication to TCC12 and to report to members on the system once the switch is made to the new provider as an update on whether the system represents any issues for the operation of the Commission VMS. This CCM asked the Secretariat to consider placing provisions in the SLA with FFA that the service provider give prior notice next time a change of this magnitude is undertaken.
WCPFC12,757,"The Deputy Director of the FFA noted these as good suggestions. A report on how the switch went, when it happens, was considered to be a good idea. The Commission was assured that the FFA Secretariat had taken the design elements seriously, and the data rules and other elements are adequately respected. It was noted that the Secretariat was taking extra time with the system switch to be absolutely certain. In response to a question about the budget, the Deputy Director of the FFA provided an assurance that the cost savings will be very significant with the new system, USD$150,000 a year or more."
WCPFC12,758,The Chair thanked the FFA and WCPFC Secretariats for their work on changes to the Commission VMS.
WCPFC12,759,"The Commission noted WCPFC12-2015-29 on the WCPFC VMS, noting budgetary implications would be considered by FAC9. 18.2 Other matters"
WCPFC12,760,RMI noted that discussions had taken place in the margins on marine pollution from fishing vessels and encouraged all interested CCMs to continue discussing the idea and for the Secretariat to continue its work on this matter and relevant sub-committees to take up the issue further.
WCPFC12,761,"Ecuador asked for guidance on the process of applying to become a full member of the Commission, noting that this was the second year in a row that some CNMs have expressed an interest in becoming members."
WCPFC12,762,"The WCPFC Legal Advisor noted that the SWG had discussed the process. On future applications for CNM status, CNMs can indicate their interest in becoming full members by ticking a box on the application. This will provide the opportunity for TCC to consider the CNM application and make a recommendation that would then be considered by the Commission. The Legal Advisor noted that there are no formal rules on how the Commission is to consider membership of the Commission, and Article 35 of the Convention only refers to membership of the Commission being agreed to by consensus. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)100"
WCPFC12,763,"The Pew Charitable Trusts expressed a sense of déjà vu, recalling that at the end of WCPFC12 it called on governments to get together throughout the year, to discuss and negotiate as necessary to deliver on their obligations to end overfishing and rebuild bigeye. Despite much discussion WCPFC12 delivered no additional reductions in bigeye mortality, and demonstrated no political will to do so. Despite having the strongest underlying charter of any of the tuna RFMOs, Pew stated that WCPFC has failed again failed to use the tools at its disposal to end overfishing and responsibly manage bigeye, observing that many CCMs seem to follow the approach that ‘something must be done as long as it is not me doing it.’ Emerging with no more than last year’s meeting did is an indictment on CCMs, despite the Chair’s substantial efforts to create consensus and drive discussion. Pew commented that it appears that some CCMs simply come to this meeting to prevent further management, or to look for ways to avoid it, and observed that if the Commission is to be successful, things have to change – less arguing about in-zone management and more focus on achieving high seas controls; a commitment to fully moving forward with harvest strategies, enacting regulatory measures for transshipment and stronger port-state measures, and ensuring that MCS standards are strong and comprehensive. Pew implored CCMs not to congratulate themselves because an interim reference point for skipjack was adopted, commenting that so much more is necessary and should have been achieved.  AGENDA ITEM 19 – SUMMARY REPORT OF THE WCPFC12"
WCPFC12,764,"The Secretariat advised that within seven working days of the end of the meeting a final draft of the Outcomes Document (WCPFC12-2015-30_rev1) containing the decisions taken at WCPFC12 would be available on the Commission website. It was proposed that the Commission would clear the meeting Summary Report intersessionally, as per past practice."
WCPFC12,765,There were no objections to this proposal.  AGENDA ITEM 20 – CLOSE OF MEETING
WCPFC12,766,"The Philippines expressed appreciation to the people of the Republic of Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12, their unceasing hospitality and for the meeting arrangements."
WCPFC12,767,"EU extended its thanks to the government of Indonesia and thanked the Chair for her excellent job guiding the Commission through the difficult discussions which were had this year. This CCM thanked the Executive Director and the Secretariat for their support, SPC for its guidance on scientific matters, and while the outcomes were disappointing there was a clear spirit of working together."
WCPFC12,768,"The USA thanked the government of Indonesia for the warm welcome the delegates received, the Chair and Executive Director for their leadership, the Secretariat staff and fellow Commissioners for their efforts. This CCM was leaving Bali with some frustrations, but noted its commitment to the Commission’s work intersessionally."
WCPFC12,769,"The Executive Director added the Secretariat’s gratitude to WCPFC12’s host government, for supporting the Secretariat in managing the logistics for the more than 500 delegates who attended the meeting. The Executive Director expressed appreciation to his staff for the enormous amount of work they undertook during the meeting and in the lead up to it, including preparing and coordinating the documents which facilitated the Commission’s deliberations. The Executive Director noted USA’s comments on the necessity to provide information during the intersessional period so that when delegates attend the formal meetings of the Commission they are equipped with the data and requisite knowledge needed to make meaningful decisions. The Chair’s leadership and guidance was strongly acknowledged and commended. The Executive Director noted that these were not easy issues to progress as these were WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)101  international multilateral negotiations and getting agreement was always going to be difficult, especially given the multi-gear and multi-stock character of the fisheries the Commission is mandated to manage. The Executive Director noted that he had listened intently to some of the exchanges and reinforced the point that the Commission’s work should not be limited just to the annual meetings and the sub-committee meetings. The Executive Director undertook to continue reaching out to members and stakeholder in promoting and facilitating the continuation of the kind of conversations had at the Commission in less formal settings. The Executive Director wished all delegates safe travel and greetings for the festive season ahead."
WCPFC12,770,"The Chair warmly thanked the people of Bali and the government of Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12, and thanked delegates for placing their trust in her to guide their work as Chair. There were mixed outcomes this year – some good gains and also some issues that were not able to move very far. The Chair credited the delegates for their willingness to cooperate and to keep the discussions going, noting that everyone gave their best, worked hard and looked for ways to compromise. The Chair acknowledged there was a need to consider alternatives way to progress the management of stocks, which is the major issue on which the Commission has found itself unable to progress and WCPFC’s key mandate. The Chair advised the Commission that she will continue to work with the Executive Director and members to try to explore options to move these critically important issues forward and capitalise on the commitment shown throughout the week. The Chair specially thanked the Executive Director for his leadership, the Secretariat staff, not only for preparing the Chair for the meeting but for preparing all the delegates, and the rapporteur, Dr Jane Broweleit. It was acknowledged that the work behind the scenes undertaken by the Secretariat and SPC was substantial. The Chair looked forward to working with members in 2016 and seeing them in Fiji for the next annual meeting, and wished participants safe travel home."
WCPFC12,771,"The hosting country Indonesia extended its thanks to the delegates for coming to Indonesia, and wished all participants safe flights."
WCPFC12,772,The meeting closed at 7:00pm on Tuesday 8 December 2015.
