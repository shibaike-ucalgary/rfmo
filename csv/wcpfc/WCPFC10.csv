WCPFC10,16,"The depository of the Convention, New Zealand, advised WCPFC10 that since its last report at WCPFC9, it has received an instrument of ratification from Indonesia showing entry into force on 29 November 2013.  WCPFC10’s attention was drawn to a declaration received along with the instrument of ratification which clarifies the application of the Convention to Indonesian waters (WCPFC10-2013/06)."
WCPFC10,17,Indonesia thanked the WCPFC for welcoming it as a member noting that it has been working toward ratification for the last eight years.  In order to mark the occasion of its joining the WCPFC Indonesia expressed an offer to host WCPFC11 in Bali.  Indonesia also acknowledged the capacity building support it has received from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Oceanic Fisheries Management project and voiced its support for the extension of this project.

WCPFC10,19,The Chair referred to the list of approved WCPFC Observers (WCPFC10-2013/07) and welcomed observer representatives to the meeting.   2.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) Status
WCPFC10,20,The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that decisions regarding applications for CNM status (WCPFC10-2013/08) are to be handled in two distinct steps:  a decision on whether to grant this status and a decision on the participatory rights to be awarded to each CNM.
WCPFC10,21,"The Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC) Chair, Rhea Moss-Christian, summarized the status of the CNM applications.  TCC9 reviewed applications from Belize, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Ecuador, El Salvador, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam, and considered that all should be considered by WCPFC10 subject to receipt of the further financial and technical information requested from each applicant.  Some of the applicants provided information on their financial contributions to the Commission but receipt of the full contribution was only confirmed for Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama and Vietnam.  A contribution from Thailand was received but was slightly short of the full amount requested.  Responses received from Belize, Thailand and Vietnam were made available for CCM review on the Commission’s secure website."
WCPFC10,22,"After some discussion WCPFC10 agreed to conduct discussions on both the decision regarding CNM status and the granting of participatory rights within a small working group (SWG-CNM).  Framework documents for the SWG-CNM were CMM 2009-11 and Secretariat paper WCPFC10-2013/08.  The SWG-CNM proposed draft decision points or report language where possible, with the working group noting that final decisions were to be made by the wider Commission meeting.  Information reviewed included i) TCC9’s recommendations and requests regarding individual CNM applications; ii) information provided by applicants subsequent to TCC9; and iii) information provided during the course of the WCPFC10 SWG-CNM meeting."
WCPFC10,23,"TCC9 recommended that the Commission consider all CNM applications subject to the additional information requested being provided to, and accepted by, the Commission.  The SWG-CNM reiterated that any information requested by TCC should be provided in advance of the regular session of WCPFC, to allow due consideration of this material by CCMs.  Building on a recommendation from TCC9, the SWG-CNM confirmed the need for a CNM application template to be developed, based on CMM 2009-11, that clearly outlines the requirements for CNM applicants.  This was a key discussion point from the SWG-CNM.  A template was considered necessary to assist with clarity in relation to the application process.  Also, some CNMs noted the view that parts of the application process did not directly relate to their participation in the WCPFC.  Some members of the SWG-CNM also raised concerns about consistent application of CMM 2009-11 requirements such as financial contribution.    Granting of CNM Status for 2014"
WCPFC10,24,The SWG-CNM did not consider TCC9’s recommendations in relation to Indonesia given the recent deposit of its instrument of ratification.      6 Belize
WCPFC10,25,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Belize to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. information on compliance with the provisions of the Convention and CMMs of the Commission and fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area; ii. information with regard to responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention; iii. information on compliance with CMMs of other RFMOs; iv. what measures were taken to ensure compliance by its vessels with the Commission’s CMMs; and v. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,26,The SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by Belize and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,27,FFA members stated their general satisfaction with the application and supported renewal of Belize’s CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,28,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Belize.    Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
WCPFC10,29,"TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask DPRK to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. commitment to have nationals comply with provisions of the Convention and CMMs adopted by the Commission; ii. AR Part I and II report for 2013, and information regarding any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; iii. how soon the financial contribution for 2013 can be paid; iv. information on compliance with the provisions of the Convention and the CMMs adopted by the Commission and the fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area; v. information with regard to responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention; vi. information on compliance with CMMs of other RFMOs; vii. information on what measures taken to ensure compliance by its vessels with the Commission’s CMMs; and viii. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs adopted by the Commission and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag."
WCPFC10,30,No information was received from DPRK that was considered by the SWG-CNM. Information was received by the Secretariat on 3 December 2013 advising that a member of the DPRK delegation is intending to visit WCPFC offices early in 2014 and indicating that a financial contribution for 2012-2014 would then be paid.  The SWG-CNM invited the Commission to consider the DPRK application in light of this.      7
WCPFC10,31,FFA members noted that the DPRK did not provide the requested information nor its assessed contribution for 2013.  These CCMs stated that if the assessed contribution for 2013 is not received it should be accrued and added to the 2014 assessed contribution and any further applications from the DPRK should not be considered unless the full accrued payment is received.
WCPFC10,32,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to the DPRK.    Ecuador
WCPFC10,33,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Ecuador to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. details of current fishing presence in the Convention Area; ii. information on compliance with the provisions of the Convention and the CMMs adopted by the Commission and the fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area; iii. details of the characteristics of current vessels; and iv. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs adopted by the Commission and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,34,Ecuador was a participant in the SWG-CNM and advised that a formal letter of response had been sent to the Secretariat prior to WCPFC10.  This letter was presented to the SWG-CNM and outlined Ecuador’s position that the information requested from TCC9 was largely included in Ecuador’s original CNM application (to TCC9) or on the vessel register.
WCPFC10,35,"Upon review, the SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by Ecuador and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014."
WCPFC10,36,FFA members thanked Ecuador for the information provided and for its financial contribution and supported renewal of its CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,37,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Ecuador.    El Salvador
WCPFC10,38,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask El Salvador to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. commitment to have nationals comply with the provisions of the Convention and CMMs adopted by the Commission;  ii. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; iii. information on responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention; and iv. information of responses to alleged violations of CMMs adopted by the Commission and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,39,El Salvador was a participant in the SWG-CNM and provided information in relation to the TCC9 request during WCPFC10.      8
WCPFC10,40,"Upon review, the SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by El Salvador and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014."
WCPFC10,41,FFA members thanked El Salvador for the information provided and for its financial contribution and supported renewal of its CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,42,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to El Salvador.    Mexico
WCPFC10,43,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Mexico to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. explicit commitment to accept high seas boarding and inspections in accordance with the Commission’s procedures on high seas boarding and inspection;  ii. information on names of historical fishing vessels; iii. commitment to provide financial contribution; iv. AR Part II report; v. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; vi. information on compliance with the provisions of the Convention and the CMMs adopted by the Commission and the fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area; vii. information on responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention; and viii. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs adopted by the Commission and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,44,"Mexico was a participant in the SWG-CNM and advised that it had provided information as part of its original CNM application which addressed some of the TCC9 requests.  Mexico stated it does not have any vessels in the WCPO area and that it continues to have a domestic legal constraint to accepting high seas boarding and inspection, and issues attributing budget for financial contribution, given lack of fishing presence.  Mexico also made a substantial statement to the SWG-CNM outlining their relationship to the WCPFC."
WCPFC10,45,"Upon consideration, and noting the general requirements that apply to all CNMs, the SWG-CNM was satisfied with the explanation and information provided by Mexico and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014."
WCPFC10,46,FFA members noted that Mexico did not provide its assessed contribution for 2013.  These CCMs stated that if the assessed contribution for 2013 is not received it should be accrued and added to the 2014 assessed contribution and any further applications from Mexico should not be considered unless the full accrued payment is received.  FFA members also questioned why Mexico had made previous commitments to accepting WCPFC high seas boarding and inspection procedures but now maintains that it has domestic legal constraints which prevent this.
WCPFC10,47,"Mexico explained that because it does not fish in the WCPF Convention Area its domestic legal constraints prevent it from obtaining funds to pay its assessed financial contribution.  Furthermore, Mexico considered that because it has no vessels operating in the WCPF Convention Area (including the overlap area) there should be no need for it to agree high seas boarding and inspection procedures, and in fact due to domestic legal interpretations   9 regarding the high seas it would be difficult to do so.  Nevertheless Mexico stated that it remains fully committed to conservation and management of WCPFC fish stocks, particularly Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC10,48,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Mexico.    Panama
WCPFC10,49,"TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Panama to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:  i. commitment to have fishing vessels and nationals comply with provisions of the Convention and CMMs adopted by the Commission; ii. full data on its historical fisheries in the Convention Area, including nominal catches, number/type of vessels, name of fishing vessels, fishing effort and fishing areas; iii. details of current fishing presence in the Convention Area, including the number of its vessels and their characteristics; iv. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; and v. information on what measures taken to ensure compliance by its vessels with the Commission’s CMMs."
WCPFC10,50,Information was provided by Panama in advance of WCPFC10 which addressed some of the TCC requirements.  Information was also provided during WCPFC10.  The SWG-CNM noted some difficulty linking the information provided by Panama to the specific TCC requests.
WCPFC10,51,"Noting these comments, the SWG-CNM invited the Commission to renew CNM status for Panama in 2014."
WCPFC10,52,FFA members stated their general satisfaction with the application and supported renewal of Panama’s CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,53,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Panama.    Thailand
WCPFC10,54,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Thailand to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; ii. information on responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention; iii. information on what measures taken to ensure compliance by its vessels with the Commission’s CMMs; and iv. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,55,The SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by Thailand and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014.      10
WCPFC10,56,"FFA members stated their general satisfaction with the application and supported renewal of Thailand’s CNM status for 2014.  However, the shortfall in payment of Thailand’s assessed contribution for 2013 should be accrued and added to its 2014 assessed contribution."
WCPFC10,57,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Thailand.    Vietnam
WCPFC10,58,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Vietnam to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; ii. information on record of compliance with the provisions of the Convention and CMMs of the Commission and the fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area;  iii. information on responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag; iv. information on what  measures taken to ensure compliance by its vessels with the Commission’s CMMs; v. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,59,The SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by Vietnam and invited the Commission to renew CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,60,"FFA members stated their general satisfaction with the application and supported renewal of Vietnam’s CNM status for 2014.  However, the small transaction shortfall in payment of the assessed contribution for 2013 should be accrued and added to its 2014 assessed contribution."
WCPFC10,61,"One CCM, while supporting the renewal of Vietnam’s CNM status for 2014, called for Vietnam to take responsibility for overseeing shipbuilding activities, such as those underway for 10 large purse seiners, in order to avoid contributing to overcapacity in the region."
WCPFC10,62,Vietnam thanked CCMs for their support of its CNM application.
WCPFC10,63,One CCM stated that as a CNM Vietnam should assist with implementing WCPFC CMMs including those with provisions regarding capacity and fishing effort. The CCM also requested Vietnam to convey to the home government Commission’s concerns for purse seine overcapacity issue in the WCPO. Vietnam agreed with this request.
WCPFC10,64,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Vietnam.
WCPFC10,65,"FFA members made a general statement regarding their concern that CNM applicants are not being held to the requirements of CMM 2009-11, in particular that their applications continue to be accepted even if the assessed financial contributions are not paid.  These CCMs indicated that a stricter approach would be adopted when considering future applications from all CNMs.  FFA members also reiterated the request of the SWG-CNM   11 that a template be developed to clearly specify the type of information that should accompany submission of CNM applications.    Participatory Rights"
WCPFC10,66,"The SWG-CNM then considered the issue of participatory rights.  Where a decision to renew status was proposed, the SWG-CNM assessed associated participatory rights with existing rights treated as the starting point for discussion subject to comment from SWG-CNM participants."
WCPFC10,67,"In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following limits apply to the participatory rights of Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCM’s national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  Such CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC CMMs.  In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV).  CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will be conditional on full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC."
WCPFC10,68,The CNMs identified below provide assurances that they will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing.
WCPFC10,69,"With respect to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, the Commission will consider how the Compliance Monitoring Reports of CNMs relate to the consideration of granting CNM status or determining participatory rights during the process of developing responses to non-compliance."
WCPFC10,70,The Commission advised CNMs to ensure that they meet the deadline for submission of applications for CNM status and meet all the obligations contained in CMM 2009-11.  The Commission noted that failure to meet the above requirements could prejudice the future granting or renewal of CNM status.    WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC10,71,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area south of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area. Accordingly, the participatory rights for Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico below apply to the WCPFC Convention Area excluding the overlap area."
WCPFC10,72,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the   12 RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for their fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC10,73,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.    Belize"
WCPFC10,74,"WCPFC10 granted Belize the following participatory rights:    i. Belize’s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to a longline bigeye catch of 803.25 mt and a longline yellowfin catch of 707 mt. ii. Belize’s fishing activities are further limited to the following: a. Under CMM 2010-05 (or subsequent revision) in accordance with paragraph 1, Belize is limited to historical catch level for 2004 of two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 20˚S; b. Under CMM 2005-03 Belize is limited to the 2005 level of five unique longliners in the Convention Area north of the equator; and c. Under CMM 2006-04, Belize is limited to two unique longliners in the Convention area south of 15˚S."
WCPFC10,75,The Chair of the SWG-CNM explained that Belize’s limit for longline catch of yellowfin tuna (707 mt) is based on 2001-2004 average catch levels and is consistent with WCPFC10’s discussions of the tropical tuna CMM.    Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
WCPFC10,76,WCPFC10 agreed that the DPRK has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.    Ecuador
WCPFC10,77,WCPFC10 agreed that the participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only.  Ecuador has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.    El Salvador
WCPFC10,78,WCPFC10 agreed that the participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only.  The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area.    Mexico
WCPFC10,79,"WCPFC10 agreed that Mexico has participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC8 and NC9 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific Bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to   13 continue to participate in the NC.  Mexican participation in the WCPO tuna fisheries may not begin until all requested information and commitments have been provided to the WCPFC Secretariat in accordance with the Commission requirements.  The participatory rights of Mexico for fishing in the WCPFC Convention Area are limited to purse seine fishing only.  Mexico has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.    Panama"
WCPFC10,80,WCPFC10 agreed that the participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    Thailand
WCPFC10,81,WCPFC10 noted the need for cooperation between Thailand and the Commission and the commitment from Thailand to provide data from canneries located in Thailand to assist in the work of the Commission.  WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status to Thailand for 2014 on the understanding that Thailand will cooperate fully with the Commission in the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data.  The Commission notes the provision of data from Thai canneries and encourages Thailand to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data.  The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    Vietnam
WCPFC10,82,"WCPFC10 noted the need for continued cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, as well as on the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data, for which Vietnam would require assistance.  The Commission noted the significant improvements in the collection and provision of data from Vietnam fisheries through the GEF WPEA project, administered by the WCPFC, and encouraged Vietnam to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data.  The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CCM REPORTS 3.1 Report of the Executive Director on the Work on the Commission"
WCPFC10,83,"The Executive Director presented his report on the work of the Commission for 2013 (WCPFC10-2013/09).  Highlights included the delivery of all services within budget, the recruitment of ‘Ana Taholo as Assistant Compliance Manager, and maintenance of Commission buildings and establishment of housing for the Executive Director and two members of staff.  Ongoing issues were noted to include:  i) power supply instabilities on the island and ii) the unreliability of United Airlines service which is adding time and expense to staff travel plans.     14 3.2 Statements by CCMs"
WCPFC10,84,The Chair invited WCPFC10 participants to make brief opening statements.
WCPFC10,85,"Tuvalu stated that its fisheries resources are critical to its survival as it has few other natural resources with which to support its people.  Tuvalu is highly dependent on FAD fishing and existing restrictions on FAD fishing (e.g. in the form of the three month FAD closure) cause it to incur a direct economic loss calculated at 1.5 million USD per month.  In this sense Tuvalu feels that additional FAD closures would lead to it bearing an unfair and disproportionate burden for tropical tuna conservation which primarily benefits other, more economically well-off CCMs."
WCPFC10,86,"Samoa noted that it has established an effort limit of 150 days for purse seine fishing in its EEZ under CMM 2012-01, para. 14 (WCPFC10-2013/DP-22).  Samoa noted that it may establish or adjust other limits in the interest of domestic food security, income and employment while maintaining tuna stocks at healthy levels."
WCPFC10,87,"Niue informed WCPFC10 that through a process of full consultation it had set catch limits for South Pacific albacore, yellowfin and bigeye tunas for the longline fishery, and skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tunas for the purse seine fishery under CMM 2012-01, para. 14 (WCPFC10-2013/DP-25).  Niue considers this a milestone in the management of their fisheries."
WCPFC10,88,New Caledonia stated that its priority is to establish a strong framework for the management of South Pacific albacore but that it also wishes to see the Commission’s compliance capabilities strengthened in general.  New Caledonia informed WCPFC10 that it has banned shark fishing and finning and is currently engaged in a review of working conditions for fishermen under the International Labour Organization’s Work in Fishing Convention of 2007.
WCPFC10,89,"Tonga highlighted the importance of ensuring that the Commission’s CMMs result in benefits accruing to small island developing States (SIDS) including the development of their domestic fleets and economies.  While Tonga confirmed that it will continue to fulfil its responsibilities for fisheries management, for example through its recent participation in monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) activities and completion of a National Plan of Action (NPOA)-Sharks, it noted that such activities can strain the capacity of SIDS."
WCPFC10,90,"Greenpeace, the Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF and the International Game Fish Association stated their concern that the WCPFC is not taking appropriate action on issues ranging from the overfishing of bigeye tuna, overcapacity in the South Pacific albacore fishery, lack of management and overfishing for some shark species, high seas transhipment and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.  These observers urged participants in WCPFC10 to avoid stalemates and seek common ground beyond national positions."
WCPFC10,91,The Philippines reaffirmed its commitment to long-term sustainable fisheries as demonstrated by its record of implementing the Commission’s CMMs and cooperating with other CCMs.
WCPFC10,92,"The International Game Fish Association noted that recreational fishing activities are increasing around the world and urged WCPFC10 to i) manage all billfishes to levels   15 above their maximum sustainable yield (MSY) to allow recreational fishing, ii) establish a rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna, and iii) take management action to conserve sharks."
WCPFC10,93,One CCM stated that observers should not be permitted to make opening statements across the floor but should submit such statements in writing.
WCPFC10,94,The Chair noted advice from the WCPFC Legal Advisor regarding the order in which CCMs and observers are offered the floor for opening statements.    3.3 Special Requirements of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and CCM Reports on the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention
WCPFC10,95,FFA members called for the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS.  When developed CCMs report on their implementation of Article 30 of the Convention they were requested to i) operationalize Article 30 in all Commission decision-making; ii) target assistance in areas identified in WCPFC10-2013/DP-02; iii) avoid transferring a disproportionate burden as described in WCPFC10-2013/DP-01; and iv) develop criteria to evaluate new proposals in terms of their potential negative impacts on SIDS.  CCMs were asked to integrate these considerations into all the work of the Commission.
WCPFC10,96,"FFA members also noted that when considering the impact of Commission measures on SIDS, the focus should be on three key areas:  i) support increased commercialism of SIDS fisheries; ii) enhance SIDS capacity for conservation and management; and iii) recognise the importance of and implement rights-based management."
WCPFC10,97,"Referring specifically to WCPFC10-2013/DP-02, FFA members identified assistance needs in six key areas:  i) revise CMM 2012-01 to avoid any disproportionate burden; ii) protect and increase SIDS participation in the South Pacific albacore fishery; iii) increase SIDS capacity in the areas of compliance, data analysis/science and bioeconomic analysis, and implementation of the Information Management System (IMS); iv) increase budgets for SIDS participation in meetings, particularly Chairs and Vice-Chairs of subsidiary bodies; v) develop E-reporting, national observer programmes and port sampling for transhipment operations; and vi) rationalise Commission workloads, prioritisation of issues and streamlining agendas."
WCPFC10,98,"FFA members explained that effective participation in meetings of the Commission goes beyond travel funding and requires capacity building for data management, science and compliance.  While those CCMs that have contributed to the Special Requirements Fund and the Japan Trust Fund are appreciated, all CCMs were invited to contribute in these or other ways."
WCPFC10,99,"FFA members also noted two specific priorities for the development of the CMR process.  These include i) observer debriefing and data management, and ii) capacity building for national plans of action, license conditions, VMS obligations and mitigation measures."
WCPFC10,100,"FFA members introduced a proposal for a new CMM containing the principles previously expressed in Resolution 2008-01 (WCPFC10-2013/DP-36 (rev 1)).  The proposed CMM contains sections on capacity development of personnel, technology transfer, fisheries conservation and management, MCS, and support for SIDS’ domestic fishing industries.  The proposal would also require that developed CCMs report against the new CMM in Annual Reports-Part 2.  CCMs were encouraged to support this binding measure in order to   16 avoid a situation in which SIDS are overwhelmed by the rising obligations of the Commission."
WCPFC10,101,"With specific reference to avoiding transfer of a disproportionate burden to SIDS, FFA members noted that two papers (WCPFC10-2013/DP-01 and WCPFC10-2013/DP-33) lay out suggestions for assessing the flows of costs and benefits to SIDS arising from management actions.  These members noted that thus far the onus has been on SIDS to make these assessments themselves and this constitutes a disproportionate burden in and of itself.  Specific criteria to be applied when WCPFC considers a new proposal were presented in WCPFC10-2013/DP-02.  FFA members tabled a proposed CMM requiring these criteria be applied to any WCPFC conservation and management proposal in the form of explanatory note attached to the proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35)."
WCPFC10,102,FFA members expressed a desire to open a two-way dialogue with developed CCMs on these important issues.
WCPFC10,103,One CCM supported the position of FFA members and noted that operationalizing Article 30 requires more than the provision of development assistance.  This CCM considered that recognizing the special requirements of SIDS requires respecting and strengthening coastal States’ rights through more tangible approaches.
WCPFC10,104,"Some CCMs stated that while they acknowledge and respect the intentions contained in the proposals the range of issues covered exceeds the authority of their delegations to comment upon.  Nevertheless, these CCMs expressed a desire to further clarify and consider the contents of the proposals."
WCPFC10,105,WCPFC10 continued discussion of these issues under Agenda Items 11.1.11 and 11.1.12.   3.3.1 CCM Reports on the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention
WCPFC10,106,"The EU stated that it has allocated $45 million US for the DevFish2, SciCoFish and ACP2 projects, implemented by FFA and SPC, to promote tuna sustainable management and ensure economic benefits (WCPFC10-2013/DP-37).  These projects are inter alia assisting with training of observers, stock assessment and tuna tagging.  In addition to these projects the EU stated its intention to continue supporting relevant new initiatives.    AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  CMM 2013/01 TROPICAL TUNA MEASURE 4.1 Development of a CMM on Tropical Tunas"
WCPFC10,107,The Secretariat tabled a summary of reporting received by WCPFC in accordance with CMM 2012-01 (WCPFC10-2013-10 (rev 6)).
WCPFC10,108,The Chair noted that the pre-WCPFC10 Heads of Delegation (HOD) meeting on the tropical tuna CMM spent considerable time discussing issues and decided it was appropriate to continue the discussions in an informal small group format.
WCPFC10,109,"Japan made a presentation on the struggles of Japan’s small to mid-scale longline fisheries over the past 30 years (WCPFC10-2013/DP-29a).  In overview, there has been a rapid   17 decline in catch, catch value and the number of vessels, and the fishing grounds have shrunk considerably.  Decreasing catches of bigeye and yellowfin have been replaced by albacore, sharks or swordfish, but these catches too are declining.  In one case study, the continued existence of the traditional fishing community is being threatened whereas in another case study the community is suffering from both changes in the fishery and the effects of the tsunami.  Believing that this scenario is not unique to its communities, Japan urged CCMs to take action to halt the expansion of the purse seine fleet and reverse the trends in the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks.  Particular concern was expressed about information suggesting that Sapmer, a French company based in Singapore, is planning to build ten purse seiners in Vietnam which will fish in the Convention Area to supply the Japanese market."
WCPFC10,110,France stated that it had no information on the activities of this company.
WCPFC10,111,"FFA members expressed their support for the draft tropical tuna CMM prepared by PNA members, Tokelau, Japan and the Philippines (WCPFC10-2013/DP-13 (rev 1)) noting that the priorities for FFA members are to halt overfishing of bigeye tuna, strengthen management for yellowfin and skipjack tuna stocks, and avoid further transfer of effort to the South Pacific albacore stock.  Based on the scientific advice, FFA members called for better FAD management, clearer limits on purse seine fishing, and a reduction in fishing mortality from longline fishing.  FFA members clarified that a reduction of up to 33% in the use of FADs was supported on the basis of scientific advice that this, along with reductions in longline catches, would halt the overfishing of bigeye tuna.  However, the proposed longline bigeye catch limits are considered insufficient to guarantee the desired results, and any further reduction in FAD sets will place a disproportionate burden on SIDS.  FFA members referred to proposed text within the joint draft, and delegation papers that explain this text, which suggest ways of avoiding this disproportionate burden.  In particular, FFA members called for limits on high seas purse seine effort, a high seas FAD closure, a high seas longline closure, a transfer payment fund, and development of zone-based rights throughout both longline and purse seine fisheries."
WCPFC10,112,"With regard to the high seas purse seine effort levels, FFA members stated that these should be based on 2010 levels.  FFA members would prefer that these limits are allocated but in the short term if this is not possible the high seas fishery should be closed when the 2010 limits are reached.  Reverting to baseline levels in CMM 2008-01 is not supported because it is considered i) incompatible with the scientific advice, ii) contrary to the requirement to implement compatible measures in EEZs and the high seas, and iii) would lead to increases in high seas and overall effort."
WCPFC10,113,"PNA members explained that they have made strenuous efforts to propose a practical and effective draft of the tropical tuna measure, noting that FAD closures, high seas pocket closures, 100% observer coverage and full retention of catch were first implemented under the PNA Third Implementing Arrangement.  The importance of avoiding a disproportionate burden was stressed along with the need to properly manage fisheries resources for the sake of PNA members’ economies and communities.  CCMs were encouraged to support the PNA’s joint proposal with Tokelau, Japan and the Philippines or to develop constructive, alternative proposals."
WCPFC10,114,"Japan reminded WCPFC10 that much work was expended on their joint proposal with the PNA, Tokelau and the Philippines and encouraged CCMs to support it.  Japan expressed its   18 agreement with the FFA recommendation to set a baseline for high seas purse seine effort based on 2010 levels."
WCPFC10,115,The USA explained that its proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-04) is designed to be fair and follow the scientific advice.  In recognition of the need to constrain fishing capacity the USA has previously made proposals to freeze the capacity of developed CCMs and ensure that transfer of capacity leading to an overall increase does not occur.
WCPFC10,116,"Chinese Taipei noted that it has both purse seine and longline fisheries in the WCPF Convention Area and would like to see a fair balance of measures for both.  However, since the longline fishery has already achieved its reductions, a concomitant reduction in purse seine fisheries appears to be necessary."
WCPFC10,117,"The EU stated that actions to halt overfishing of bigeye tuna are critical and should be taken by all gear types across the region in line with the scientific advice.  The EU considered that the large number of options under discussion made it difficult to consider all the implications, and therefore the number of options should be marrowed.  Clear effort limits for the high seas and review of the measure next year once new bigeye and yellowfin tuna stock assessments are available were supported."
WCPFC10,118,"China expressed support for two outcomes from the Tokyo workshop held in August 2013:  a 40% reduction in fishing mortality on bigeye tuna relative to the 2001-2004 level should be achieved by 2017, and the number of longline and purse seine vessels should be frozen."
WCPFC10,119,"Canada, noting its concerns for the stocks despite not fishing them, concurred with the EU that the measure should be linked to the scientific advice, and should limit the number of options in order to be both practical and enforceable."
WCPFC10,120,Korea thanked Japan for its presentation and comments on the longline fishery but noted that the purse seine fishery is also suffering adverse effects from overcapacity and therefore a freeze on fishing capacity is needed.
WCPFC10,121,Kiribati considered that any changes to fishing rights on the high seas could significantly affect fisheries inside adjacent EEZs.  Therefore it was suggested that domestic fishing vessels be exempted from any effort restrictions on the high seas adjacent to their EEZs.
WCPFC10,122,WCPFC10 agreed to conduct further discussions in an informal small group chaired by Matt Hooper of New Zealand.
WCPFC10,123,"After some discussion of the format and procedures for the informal small group discussions, it was agreed that the observer organizations (i.e. as defined under the WCPFC Rules of Procedure Rule 36 (f)) could be represented by a single participant in the informal small group but this representative would not participate in the discussions, and the content of the discussions would remain confidential until it is reported to the plenary."
WCPFC10,124,"After the first meeting of the informal small group, the Chair of the group reported that a number of sections of the Chair’s draft (WCPFC10-2013/11) had been discussed.  These included:  i) FAD set management (i.e. additional closure months or a fixed number of FAD sets allotted to each CCM); ii) managing purse seine effort on the high seas (i.e. how to set limits and whether to manage under Olympic or allocation rules); iii) prospects for further cuts in longline bigeye tuna catches (i.e. the need to avoid a disproportion burden   19 on purse seine fisheries and how to set baselines); iv) the need for stronger limits on yellowfin tuna catches, and v) longline limits for the high seas and during the FAD closure period.  The Chair of the group requested another session be convened to discuss capacity management issues and to produce a new draft of the tropical tuna CMM.  In response to comments from observer delegations, the Chair of the group suggested that the number of observer representatives allowed to participate in the group be expanded from one to no more than three."
WCPFC10,125,Some CCMs supported the suggestion of the Chair of the informal small group to expand the number of observers to no more than three.
WCPFC10,126,"WWF, on behalf of Pew Charitable Trusts and Greenpeace, presented WCPFC10-2013/OP-07 requesting the Commission to urgently and clearly resolve issues related to observer participation.  Given the Convention’s requirement for transparency, and the number and diversity of observer organizations attending WCPFC10, it was considered that limiting the number of observer participants in the informal small group or constraining their ability to intervene constituted unduly restrictive procedures according to the Convention text.  Although these observers appreciated the Commission’s agreement to slightly increase observer participation, and acknowledged the need for a secure forum for discussion of the draft CMM, they considered the limits on observer participation rendered the informal small group functionally closed.  The Commission was urged to avoid further exclusion of observers from Commission operations and decision-making processes."
WCPFC10,127,"After holding another informal small group session, the Chair of the group reported back to the plenary that work on a revised draft CMM was continuing.  Remaining issues were expected to centre on gaps in high seas purse seine effort limits, bigeye tuna catch reductions for the longline fisheries, and disproportionate burdens."
WCPFC10,128,"A third informal small group session was held to discuss the revised draft CMM.  The Chair of the group reported that the discussions indicated several areas of real progress including specific proposals for implementing a FAD closure.  However, a number of contentious issues remained, particularly associated with disproportionate burdens.  Further revisions to the draft were undertaken."
WCPFC10,129,"After a fourth session, the Chair of the informal small group tabled a draft CMM for discussion by the plenary (WCPFC10-2013/32 (rev5)).  The Chair of the group characterized the proposal as providing operational guidelines for the fishery in 2014 but leaving larger issues such as those associated with disproportionate burdens for future resolution.  Key issues in the draft were highlighted as follows:  i. clarification of catch attribution in the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area; ii. a three-month FAD closure for all purse seine vessels; iii. a requirement for WCPFC11 to adopt arrangements to avoid transferring a disproportionate burden to SIDS as a prerequisite to the commencement of some other components such as those in subparagraph v below;  iv. for 2014, a FAD closure of one additional month (fourth month) or a limit on FAD sets against a baseline of 2010-2012 (specified in an attachment); v. for 2015-2016, a FAD closure of two additional months (fourth and fifth months) or a limit on FAD sets against a baseline of 2010-2012 (specified in an attachment);   20 vi. for 2017, a prohibition on high seas FAD sets with an exemption for Kiribati flagged vessels in its adjacent high seas, and those CCMs that can demonstrate a reduction of bigeye tuna catches to 55% of 2010-2012 levels;  vii. high seas purse seine effort limits for non-SIDS in 2014 (specified in an attachment); viii. requirements for FAD management plans and further consideration of FAD information collection by the WCPFC Scientific Committee (SC); ix. longline catch limits for 2014-2017 for bigeye tuna catches by China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and the USA which are over 2000 tonnes (specified in an attachment);  x. no increase in longline catches of yellowfin tuna;  xi. CCMs to consider spatial management approaches;  xii. Non-SIDS, with exceptions for Indonesia and China, to cap the number of purse seine vessels larger than 24 m with freezing capacity in the tropical purse seine fishery at the current level;  xiii. Non-SIDS, with an exception for Indonesia, to cap the number of longline vessels targeting bigeye tuna at the current level; and xiv. Mechanisms for the transfer of capacity to SIDS to be developed."
WCPFC10,130,The Chair thanked participants in the informal small group and its Chair for their efforts in producing the draft measure.
WCPFC10,131,FFA members stated that they reluctantly supported the draft measure produced by the informal small group.  These CCMs considered that the opportunity to better manage the purse seine fishery was only partially taken up and other opportunities for major breakthroughs were missed due to narrow economic interests.  FFA members emphasized their determination to work toward an improved tropical tuna CMM next year.
WCPFC10,132,"PNA members expressed their disappointment that their joint draft with Tokelau, Japan and Philippines was not supported.  In their view, the joint draft would have reduced overfishing of bigeye tuna without placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS whereas the informal small group’s proposal fails to reduce overfishing in a balanced way.  These CCMs considered that their joint draft was opposed by those seeking unfettered access to the high seas, including those conducting IUU fishing activities."
WCPFC10,133,"Japan appreciated the efforts of the informal small group, its Chair and the Secretariat staff who assisted it.  While regretting that its joint efforts with PNA and FFA members did not result in the kind of measure it had hoped for, Japan reconfirmed its commitment to working with these CCMs for a more effective measure next year."
WCPFC10,134,"The Philippines echoed the views of Japan and requested that text regarding the high seas pocket (Footnote #4) from a previous draft, which appeared to have been inadvertently deleted from the draft measure, be restored."
WCPFC10,135,"Papua New Guinea also expressed its disappointment and stated that it is taking appropriate management measures in its own waters.  CCMs were requested to note a revised version of the PNA, Tokelau, Japan and Philippines joint proposal as a benchmark of what could have been achieved (Attachment C).      21"
WCPFC10,136,"WCPFC10 adopted the draft CMM produced by the informal small group, with the restoration of the footnote text requested by the Philippines, as a new CMM for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas (Attachment D:  CMM 2013-01)."
WCPFC10,137,"Greenpeace, WWF, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the International Game Fish Association stated that self-interested views had resulted in a measure that failed to impose any additional FAD-based fishing mortality reductions, included no management of FADs or the purse seine fishery beyond 2014, and contained inadequate capacity management provisions.  These observers concluded that the drafting process was ineffective and urged CCMs to begin work on a new measure immediately in order to achieve a better outcome at WCPFC11.   4.2 Consideration of CCM proposals related to 2013-01 4.2.1 USA FAD information collection and analysis"
WCPFC10,138,"The USA presented a draft CMM on collection and analysis of data on FADs (WCPFC10-2013/DP-05) stating that the IATTC had recently adopted a similar proposal.  It was noted that an earlier version of this proposal was tabled at WCPFC9 and has evolved through discussions before and during TCC9.  Several issues were highlighted as requiring further discussion including marking of FADs and designation of the responsible party for the data collection.  The proposal included i) a definition of a FAD that is consistent with those used in CMM 2008-01 and 2009-02, ii) a requirement for a Vessel FAD Data Reporting Log to be developed in 2014, and iii) initial provisions for non-entangling FADs.  While the USA did not conduct a formal analysis of the potential impact of the measure on SIDS (as called for in WCPFC-2013/DP-02 and WCPFC-2013/DP-35) specific comments on these issues were considered when preparing the text."
WCPFC10,139,Several CCMs suggested a need to discuss specific technical comments in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,140,"FFA members stated that they do not support the proposal because it is impractical in terms of FAD marking, premature in that electronic tracking is not ready for implementation, and duplicative in the sense of voluminous data reporting.  These CCMs also called for a formal analysis against the Article 30 criteria to assess whether the measure represents a disproportionate burden.  They considered that some components of the measure could be incorporated as attachments to the tropical tuna CMM."
WCPFC10,141,Later in the meeting the USA noted that some of the technical comments raised earlier had been addressed and that some components of the proposal had been incorporated into the draft CMM on tropical tunas.       22 AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  COMMISSION REVIEW 5.1 Progress on the review of the Commission – TCC9 Recommendation (para. 391)
WCPFC10,142,"The Executive Director presented a paper containing the recommendations from the WCPFC Performance Review sorted by the subsidiary body to which each recommendation relates and an annotation showing current progress in addressing each issue (WCPFC10-2013/14).  The Executive Director considered that the top three priority items that remain to be addressed are transparency (Recommendation 7.1.1), ensuring that CMMs are legally sound (Recommendation 3.4.7, see WCPFC10-2013/29), and transhipment (Recommendation 6.3.4).  It was noted that many of the performance review recommendations have already been addressed and completed.  The Executive Director suggested that all recommendations which have been addressed and completed be removed from the matrix and that the revised matrix be considered at WCPFC11."
WCPFC10,143,"FFA members agreed with the Executive Director’s suggestion on the proviso that the further streamlining of recommendations give due attention to Article 30 of the Convention, the special requirements of SIDS, and the need to avoid placing disproportionate burden on SIDS."
WCPFC10,144,"WCPFC10 agreed that the Secretariat would revise the matrix contained in WCPFC10-2013/14 to remove all recommendations which have been addressed and completed, and present the revised matrix to WCPFC11.    AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  REPORT OF THE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES WORKSHOP 6.1 Report on Progress from MOW2"
WCPFC10,145,"Dr Ian Cartwright (Thalassa Consulting) presented the report of the Second Management Options Workshop (MOW2) held 28-29 November 2013.  MOW1 was held before WCPFC9 and was mainly concerned with awareness raising and consideration of a wide range of objectives.  Following MOW1 a ‘Strawman’ (i.e. a candidate list of management objectives, performance indicators, and target reference points (TRPs)) for the tropical longline fishery, the tropical purse seine fishery, the southern longline fishery, the Pacific bluefin tuna fishery and the North Pacific albacore fishery was completed and provided to SC9, NC9 and TCC9 for comment.  Further suggestions for amendments were made following the presentation at MOW 2 and during breakout groups and these were reflected in a final ‘Strawman’ document (WCPFC10-2013/15b).  In that workshop a series of plenary workshop presentations showing examples of the application of target reference points, harvest control rules (HCRs) and trade-offs were provided, followed by break-out groups.  The last day of the workshop drew together comments from the break-out groups via plenary discussions.  A report of MOW2 was provided (WCPFC10-2013/15a), including a recommendation for an interim spawning biomass target reference point for skipjack."
WCPFC10,146,"One CCM requested Dr Cartwright to reflect its suggestion, which was made and accepted at MOW 2 on “Strawman” exactly. Dr Cartwright accepted this.    23"
WCPFC10,147,WCPFC10 accepted the MOW2 (WCPFC10-2013/15a) and “Strawman” (WCPFC10-2013/15a) reports (Attachment E).
WCPFC10,148,"With reference to the recommendation to set a TRP for skipjack tuna at 0.5 unfished spawning biomas, some CCMs considered that as the proposal had only emerged in the last few days there hadn’t been sufficient time to consider it fully in terms of costs and benefits to all fisheries."
WCPFC10,149,One CCM asked for and received confirmation from the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) that the proposed TRP for skipjack is twice as high as the estimated BMSY (which is 0.27unfished spawning biomas).
WCPFC10,150,"One CCM suggested that a range of candidate TRPs including 0.4unfished spawning biomas, 0.5unfished spawning biomas, and 0.6unfished spawning biomas might be endorsed for further consideration.  After consulting with other CCMs in the margins of WCPFC10, and taking input from SPC that it would not be possible to complete further analyses in time for consideration by SC10, this CCM provided draft text on development of a TRP for skipjack for WCPFC10’s consideration."
WCPFC10,151,"WCPFC10 agreed that the Scientific Services Provider provide the following to MOW3 with progress reported to SC10 in 2014 with a view to informing the Commission’s consideration and adoption of a TRP and HCR at WCPFC 11:    i. Evaluate WCPO skipjack stock status against candidate target reference points of 40%, 50% and 60% of unfished spawning stock size. ii. Apply stock-wide harvest control rules such as those present in MOW2-WP/03 and examine robustness relative to the new assessment and major sources of uncertainty. iii. Include performance indicators relating to fish sizes, impacts on yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna, and examine the acceptable magnitude of changes in fishing effort.   6.2 Future Work Plan and Funding"
WCPFC10,152,"Dr Ian Cartwright provided a proposal for continuing the MOW process.  The proposal was based on formal and informal elements, incorporating annual workshops and input into the development of elements of a WCPFC management framework."
WCPFC10,153,"The Chair invited WCPFC10 to consider whether the work of the MOW Independent Expert Panel should be continued.  An initial cost estimate suggested that $350,000 would be required for a two-year extension of the work programme."
WCPFC10,154,PNA members suggested that they could adopt the skipjack TRP as proposed.  Therefore further analysis is not required and should not be included in the Commission’s budget.
WCPFC10,155,"Some CCMs queried why the estimated costs had risen from $100,000 (presented to the FAC) to $350,000, whether more detailed costings would be provided, and whether there might be other funding mechanisms available."
WCPFC10,156,"The Executive Director clarified that the difference in costs arose because the initial estimate had been based on just one additional workshop whereas the new proposal reflects   24 a two-year work programme involving one workshop each year, continued input from the expert panel, and additional scientific and economic analyses to be performed by SPC.  He acknowledged, based on discussions in the FAC, that there are concerns about the amount of funding requested and suggested that external funding sources could be sought.  He also noted that the PNA will be developing a TRP for skipjack tuna in parallel with this work."
WCPFC10,157,Some CCMs indicated their general support for the management options work but were concerned about the proposed costs and considered it necessary to analyse the results produced thus far before proceeding with additional work.
WCPFC10,158,Some CCMs agreed with the need to carefully consider the output thus far but urged the Commission not to lose momentum in the development of its fisheries management framework.
WCPFC10,159,"One CCM noted that work on limit reference points (LRPs), TRPs and HCR is proceding under the Northern Committee."
WCPFC10,160,Some CCMs supported authorization of funding for the two annual workshops and suggested that external funding be sought to support the continued input of the expert panel and the analyses by SPC.
WCPFC10,161,One CCM supported authorizing funding for one additional workshop only.
WCPFC10,162,"In response to a question regarding whether there would be any value in holding a workshop without any input material from the expert panel and the SPC analyses, the Executive Director considered that at a minimum an additional workshop would provide the opportunity for CCMs to discuss the outputs produced by MOW1 and MOW2."
WCPFC10,163,ISSF and WWF stated their support for continued work on management options and offered to assist in securing the funding necessary for the full package of work proposed.
WCPFC10,164,"WCPFC agreed to hold an additional workshop on management options (MOW3) in 2014 and to task the Executive Director with exploring external sources of funding for a second workshop in 2015, further input from the expert panel and supporting analyses by the Scientific Services Provider.    AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  REPORT OF THE E-MONITORING AND E-REPORTING STUDY 7.1 Report from the Study"
WCPFC10,165,"Dr Ian Knuckey (Fishwell Consulting) presented the results of the E-reporting and E-monitoring study (WCPFC10-2013/16).  The objectives of the project were to:  i) develop a common understanding and language of E-reporting and E-monitoring; ii) document and evaluate existing and future E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies; and  iii) propose potential scenarios for implementation of E-reporting and E-monitoring in the WCPO tuna fisheries.  E-reporting is defined as an “open system” relying on manual inputs and transmission whereas E-monitoring is defined as a “closed system” in which video or sensor data is collected and transmitted automatically.  A global review revealed an   25 abundance of E-reporting products are available that would suit WCPO tuna fisheries. There were fewer examples of E-monitoring products and limited levels of adoption in global fisheries.  The main stakeholder issues on potential implementation of E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies were presented including employment, research, compliance, efficiency and occupational health and safety.  Overall, it was concluded that improved timeliness and quality of data, together with increased efficiencies offered by E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies would provide more certainty in research and stock assessments, more targeted and certain MCS activities, and better management decisions.  Ultimately, these would lead to improved fishery sustainability.  The study produced five strategic recommendations:    i. Implement both E-reporting and E-monitoring programs without delay;  ii. Develop standards, specifications, and certification procedures for both E-reporting and E-monitoring; iii. Implement E-reporting in a phased approach determined by technical feasibility, and practical considerations and constraints; iv. Recognise E-monitoring as a legitimate, appropriate and acceptable monitoring tool; and v. Implement separate but parallel processes to move E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies forward."
WCPFC10,166,"Peter Williams (SPC) presented an update on SPC E-reporting trials conducted since August 2013.  There were two systems being trialled:  an electronic logbook (eTUNALOG; open-source and available for download on the SPC website) and an electronic data entry system for observers while onboard purse seine vessels (eTUBS).  The eTUNALOG system is configured to transmit logbook data in parallel to the fishing company and the national fisheries authority as an email attachment.  This system has been trialled with 13 purse seine vessels from the Solomon Islands, New Zealand, FSM, RMI and the USA.  The eTUBS system involves observers entering onboard data directly into a laptop; the data are not transmitted from the laptop but downloaded for auditing and import into the main observer databases on return to port.  This system has been trialled on seven purse seine trips.  Results thus far have been excellent with positive feedback received from the trial participants.  It is recognized, however, than an E-reporting coordinator is fundamental for time-intensive training, data auditing and debriefing activities."
WCPFC10,167,Ludwig Kumoru (PNG) updated WCPFC10 on PNG’s progress with electronic fisheries management systems.  Bilateral partners will begin using an electronic version of the logsheet forms in January 2014.  Observers and port samplers will begin using android operating system tablets and smartphones for E-logging by mid-2014.  The catch documentation scheme is also using E-forms including forms for transhipment.  E-monitoring of vessels is not yet implemented.   7.2 Consideration of Future Work
WCPFC10,168,"One CCM considered the consultant’s study was well done and supported progress toward E-reporting and E-monitoring systems.  However, this CCM cautioned that adequate account should be taken of developing standards in international fora (e.g. UN/CEFACT) to avoid WCPFC standards being incompatible or duplicative."
WCPFC10,169,"Some CCMs expressed support for some of the study’s recommendations regarding E-reporting and E-monitoring for centralized data management activities within the   26 Commission, but did not agree that Commission-level standards and certifications would necessarily pre-empt the development or implementation of national systems."
WCPFC10,170,"FFA members indicated that a more thorough review of the study’s recommendations regarding standards and certification procedures would be required before these could be endorsed.  Primary concerns are that any new standards and certifications be compatible with the national and regional information management systems already under development, and that any new systems learn from these existing systems.  These CCMs suggested that the Secretariat should develop draft specifications for review in parallel with a full analysis of costs and benefits to SIDS with regard to Article 30 in early 2014.  Further discussions could be held in March 2014 in conjunction with the MCS Working Group meeting in Honiara."
WCPFC10,171,"The Executive Director clarified that the objectives were not to impose systems on CCMs domestically, but rather to speed and improve the quality of data flowing to the Commission.  It was also noted that the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) project will initiate E-monitoring trials in Fiji and Ghana.  Funding received from Australia is intended to be used to consider issues related to the impacts of electronic systems on employment in SIDS."
WCPFC10,172,Some CCMs considered that if further discussion of E-reporting and E-monitoring topics is to be held in conjunction with the MCS Working Group meeting in Honiara the range of participants in that working group may need to be broadened.
WCPFC10,173,WCPFC10 agreed that further discussions on E-reporting and E-monitoring should be held at a workshop in early 2014 at a venue to be determined by the Secretariat and the result should be reported to TCC10.     AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE (SC) 8.1 Report of the Ninth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC10,174,"The SC Chair, Ludwig Kumoru (PNG), presented the report of SC9 (WCPFC10-2013/17) using a summary format (WCPFC10-2013/17a) to highlight results in the areas of stock status and assessment, data and statistics, management issues, ecosystems and bycatch, and other issues.   8.1.1 Stock Status of Key Tuna Species"
WCPFC10,175,"Dr John Hampton (SPC) summarized the status of key tuna and non-tuna stocks in the WCPO.  According to Kobe plots based on past years’ stock assessments and existing reference points, three of the four main tropical tuna stocks are in the green quadrant, i.e. they are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.  However, all three are expected to track toward higher exploitation and lower biomass levels over time.  Stock status plots may also shift as new stock assessments are completed in the coming year and as new reference points develop.  The uncertainty is relatively higher for the South Pacific albacore fishery due to the nature of the fishery and the data available.  Bigeye tuna are currently assessed as overfishing occurring but not being overfished; managing the stock to   27 reduce fishing mortality on this stock is one of the key tasks for WCPFC10.  In undertaking stock assessments in 2014 SPC will incorporate recommendations from the recent bigeye tuna stock assessment peer review in bigeye, as well as in yellowfin and skipjack, assessments."
WCPFC10,176,"The purse seine fishery in 2012 was a record high in terms of both catch (1.8 million mt) and effort.  Although most of the catch is comprised of skipjack, the yellowfin catch continues to increase.  The number of vessels in the fishery also continues to trend upwards with 2013 registering the largest number of vessels ever.  As the number of FAD sets has been stable since the mid-2000s, recent effort increases have been driven by free school sets.  Management measures requiring FAD closures do not appear to have reduced the annual number of FAD sets but have contained growth in FAD sets in the face of purse seine effort that has continued to increase despite management measures designed to control it.  Purse seine effort within PNA countries’ EEZs has been stable whereas purse seine effort on the high seas has increased slightly since 2011."
WCPFC10,177,"Longline catch has been stable over the past 10-15 years but species composition has shifted toward a larger portion of the catch comprised of South Pacific albacore in the southern hemisphere.  In the northern hemisphere longline catches of bigeye, yellowfin and northern albacore have been reasonably stable over time.  Longline effort in the tropical areas has been stable for some time but appears to show a decline in 2013.  In the southern part of the fishing grounds effort, in terms of number of days fished, continues to increase."
WCPFC10,178,"In 2012 the skipjack catch increased 9% over 2011, driven mainly by an increase in the purse seine fishery.  Although there is no evidence of persistent declines in catch per unit effort, periods of unusually low CPUE occurred in mid-2011 and possibly in the first half of 2013.  For bigeye tuna, longline fishery bigeye catches have declined steadily since the 1990s to record lows whereas overall the catch composition has shifted towards the purse seine fishery with the increased use of FADs.  Yellowfin catches were high in 2012, due to the purse seine fishery and Indonesia’s fleets, but catch per unit effort is slowly declining with time.  South Pacific albacore catches increased 24% in 2011 and was 22% higher than the five-year average.  Albacore is a declining component of the troll fishery.  Catch per unit effort by longline has declined over the last 20 years and is now ~20kg per 100 hooks, below the level of economic viability for some fleets."
WCPFC10,179,Several non-tuna species have also been assessed.  South Pacific swordfish are not likely to be overfished but there is some possibility that overfishing is occurring.  For striped marlin overfishing is not likely to be occurring but there is some possibility that the stock is overfished.  Recent shark stock assessments have indicated that the oceanic whitetip shark stock is heavily depleted and the silky shark stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring.
WCPFC10,180,The SC Chair noted six recommendations from SC9 regarding stock status and assessment:    i. Maintain the North Pacific albacore stock status and management advice from SC8 (SC9 report paras. 179-180); ii. Note majority and minority views on the stock status and management advice for Pacific bluefin tuna (SC9 report paras 194-196); iii. Maintain the North Pacific swordfish stock status and management advice from SC6 (SC9 report paras. 204-205);   28 iv. Review a revised assessment for North Pacific blue shark at SC10 and adopt a precautionary approach to management in the interim (SC9 report paras. 259-262);  v. Maintain the North Pacific striped marlin stock status and management advice from SC8 (SC9 report paras. 296-297); and  vi. Note the finding that the North Pacific blue marlin stock is not currently overfished but it is nearly fully exploited and thus the fishing mortality rate should not be increased (SC9 report paras. 308-309).
WCPFC10,181,WCPFC10 accepted the six stock status and assessment recommendations of SC9.    Data and Statistics Theme
WCPFC10,182,"The SC Chair noted seven recommendations from SC9 regarding data and statistics:    i. TCC9 to consider how to fill gaps in operational data (SC9 report para. 77a); ii. TCC9 to consider alternatives to operational data (SC9 report para. 77b); iii. WCPFC10 to note the implications arising from a lack of operational data (SC9 report para. 77c); iv. The Secretariat to contact CCMs who do not submit operational data or numbers of vessels for each spatial unit (SC9 report para. 77d); v. Other gear catches of tropical tuna excluding fisheries with <2000 mt to be forwarded to TCC9 (SC9 report para. 77e);  vi. Stock assessments for SC10 should use catch and effort data through 2012 but projections should use data through 2013 (SC9 report paras. 77f); and  vii. The Scientific Services Provider should continue work on species composition in the purse seine fishery (SC9 report, para. 90)."
WCPFC10,183,WCPFC10 accepted the seven data and statistics recommendations of SC9.    Management Issues Theme
WCPFC10,184,"The SC Chair noted seven recommendations from SC9 regarding management issues:  i. Guidelines for the time window to be used in the LRP 20%SBF=0, t1-t2 (SC9 report, paras. 357-359);  ii. Identification of the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FX%SPR0 be based on an iterative search to “match” FX%SPR0 with 20%SBF=0,t1-t2 as described in the working paper (SC9-MI-WP-03), and once the level of acceptable risk that should be applied to breaching an LRP has been identified by WCPFC10, the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FX%SPR0 be calculated using the updated assessments to be presented to SC10 (SC9 report, paras. 360-361);  iii. LRPs should be used in future stock assessment summaries (SC9 report, para. 362); iv. Early warning or trigger reference points should be identified (SC9 report, para. 363); v. Guidelines for using a hierarchical approach to describe uncertainty (SC9 report, para. 385); vi. SC10 to consider how to assign plausibility weights to models (SC9 report, para. 386); and vii. Note SC9’s conclusions regarding the draft tropical tuna CMM (SC9 report, para. 408).      29"
WCPFC10,185,"In response to a question from the Chair on time window, SPC explained that since productivity and recruitment vary over time, it is necessary to use an average value that best represents current and near future conditions.  This was the basis for the SC9 guidelines in the SC9 report at paras. 357-359."
WCPFC10,186,"The Commission endorsed SC’s recommendation for a 10 year time window in relation to the LRP 20%SBF=0, t1-t2."
WCPFC10,187,"In response to a question from the Chair on the level of risk, SPC clarified that SC9 recommended acceptable levels of risk associated with breaching LRPs at 5 or 10% for example because best practice requires that there should be a high probability that LRPs not be breached.  If the acceptable risk level is identified then scientists can work backwards to develop management strategies that meet these risk criteria.  This was the basis for the SC9 guidelines in the SC9 report at para. 361."
WCPFC10,188,"Some CCMs considered that a wider range of risks should be considered and that because the acceptable level of risk may be different for different fisheries and stocks, it would not be appropriate to set a single risk level in advance that is applied to all situations."
WCPFC10,189,Some CCMs supported the SC9 recommendation in SC9 report paras. 360-361 and requested that a 5% risk level be applied in stock assessments to be conducted for SC10.
WCPFC10,190," Some CCMs noted that the methodology proposed by SC9 to develop fishing mortality (F) based limit reference points (SC9 report paras. 357-359) is based on deriving these directly from biomass-based LRPs.  The F-based LRPs are thus not independent and may not provide an appropriate basis for developing management measures to control fishing mortality.  These CCMs encouraged the SC and science services provider to examine the expected outcomes of various management scenarios relative to reference points, providing a wider range of risk levels than the 5% and 10% levels used In SC9-MI-WP-03.  It was considered that as a biomass-based LRP has now been adopted, the Commission should focus on developing appropriate biomass-based TRPs or fishing mortality-based TRPs for yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack and south Pacific albacore."
WCPFC10,191,Japan noted that Pacific bluefin tuna are in urgent need of a stock recovery and NC 9 agreed to develop at NC10 a rebuilding programme . Japan also stated that this will involve development of a LRP by the ISC which will be presented to the Northern Committee.
WCPFC10,192,"WCPFC10 decided to refer the LRP issues of acceptable level of risk to SC, for further clarification of the implications of accepting various alternative proposals.  SC was requested to provide its recommendations to WCPFC11 in sufficient detail and in a format easily understood by managers.            30 Ecosystem and Bycatch Theme"
WCPFC10,193,"The SC Chair noted twelve recommendations from SC9 regarding ecosystem and bycatch:    i. Support the Bycatch Mitigation Information System (SC9 report, para. 419a);  ii. Support ongoing development of SEAPODYM (SC9 report, para. 419b); iii. CCMs to provide fine-scale data for use in SEAPODYM (SC9 report, para. 419c); iv. Consider an external review of SEAPODYM (SC9 report para. 419d);  v. Develop reference points for key shark species (SC9 report para. 465a); vi. Develop safe release guidelines for sharks (SC9 report para. 465b); vii. Implement logsheets showing retained and discarded sharks (SC9 report para. 465c); viii. Develop an integrated and comprehensive shark CMM (SC9 report para. 465d); ix. Consider measures to reduce mortality on overfished sharks (SC9 report para. 465e);  x. Investigate the vessel length-based exclusion from seabird mitigation measures in the North Pacific (SC9 report para. 489a); xi. Forward the ACAP seabird identification guide to observer programmes (SC9 report para. 489b); and xii. Undertake a pilot project on E-monitoring in a WCPFC longline fishery (SC9 report para. 489c)."
WCPFC10,194,WCPFC10 accepted the twelve ecosystem and bycatch recommendations of SC9.     Other Issues
WCPFC10,195,The SC Chair noted that the GEF West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Project Phase 1 was completed in March 2013 and that the development of WPEA Phase 2 is now underway.
WCPFC10,196,Dr John Hampton (SPC) informed WCPFC10 that the Pacific Tuna Tagging Project (PTTP) recently completed a successful cruise in PNG and bigeye tuna tagging is set to continue for several more years through funding received from New Zealand.  CCMs were requested to help facilitate tag returns.  A report on the PTTP was presented to SC9 (see RP-PTTP-01 and RP-PTTP-02).
WCPFC10,197,"The SC Chair noted that SC9 had recognized a request from SIDS to cooperate in four specific areas:  research and technology transfer, human resources capacity building, best practice initiatives, and data collection and monitoring and evaluation (SC9 report, para. 509)."
WCPFC10,198,WCPFC10 noted these issues from the SC9 report.     8.2 Future Work Programme and Budget for 2014-2016
WCPFC10,199,"The SC Chair noted the SC work programme and budget for 2014-2016 highlighting that stock assessments for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas and North Pacific blue shark, as well as an analysis of potential mitigation options for silky and oceanic whitetip sharks, will be conducted under the Scientific Services Provider’s current service agreement."
WCPFC10,200,The SC Chair noted that the SC had reviewed and responded to recommendations arising from the Commission’s Independent Performance Review.     31
WCPFC10,201,"The SC Chair requested nominations for an SC Vice-Chair and announced that the next meeting of the SC would be held in Majuro, RMI."
WCPFC10,202,FSM queried whether there is a formal agreement that the SC will be held in Pohnpei every other year.
WCPFC10,203,The Secretariat responded that this is a general understanding rather than a formal arrangement.
WCPFC10,204,The Chair noted that the Secretariat would discuss this issue further with FSM.    8.3 Adoption of the SC9 Summary Report
WCPFC10,205,WCPFC10 thanked the SC Chair for his efforts and adopted the SC9 Summary Report.    AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 9.1 Report of the Ninth Regular Session of the Northern Committee
WCPFC10,206,"The Chair of the Northern Committee (NC), Masanori Miyahara (Japan), presented the report of NC9 (WCPFC10-2013/18).  The meeting focused on the status of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock which was assessed as being heavily overfished and experiencing low recruitment for 2011-2012.  This situation suggests i) there is considerable risk of the spawning stock biomass falling below its historic low level, and ii) current management is likely to be less effective than expected.  A draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna was prepared (WCPFC10-2013/27) which specifies the current F as the average 2002-2004 level, calls for a 15% reduction in F for 2014 only, deletes the exemption for artisanal and Korean fleets, and requires monitoring of recruitment and development of an emergency response if recruitment is extremely low.  Korea took a reservation on the removal of its exemption.  In the coming year, the NC will develop a rebuilding programme for Pacific bluefin tuna.  NC9 discussed reference points for North Pacific albacore but did not reach agreement despite a useful paper contributed by the USA.  Also, NC9 requested that WCPFC10 task the SC with considering whether North Pacific blue shark should be designated as a northern stock.  NC9 will hold its next meeting in September in Japan."
WCPFC10,207,"Korea explained that it catches Pacific bluefin tuna as bycatch in its jack mackerel fishery, one of the most important fisheries in Korea.  While the CMM will affect this fishery, in acknowledgement of the severely depleted state of the resource, and as a responsible fishing nation, Korea agreed to withdraw its reservation.  Korea will gather more data on its bycatch of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna in order to support better management of the stock."
WCPFC10,208,Japan expressed its appreciation to Korea for withdrawing the reservation on the Korea fishery exemption.      32
WCPFC10,209,The USA committed to carrying out further work on reference points for North Pacific albacore.
WCPFC10,210,"Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF and Greenpeace noted that the latest ISC stock assessment estimates the Pacific bluefin tuna stock has been reduced to 3.6% of its unfished levels and recommends that fishing mortality be reduced.  However, under the draft CMM overall catch would be allowed to increase thereby offering inadequate protection to this severely depleted species.  These observers consider that this approach is not precautionary.  They called for a rebuilding plan to be tabled at WCPFC11 including provisions within the plan for the suspension of fishing if rebuilding is unsuccessful."
WCPFC10,211,Mexico stated that it has taken management measures in the Eastern Pacific to protect the stock but it considers that fishing nations in the Western Pacific need to do more to achieve equitable measures since most of the fishing mortality on juveniles takes place in the Western Pacific.
WCPFC10,212,Japan considered that Mexico’s fishery is catching mainly juvenile Pacific bluefin and therefore their continued participation in ISC and the NC is strongly encouraged.
WCPFC10,213,WCPFC10 adopted a revised CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (replacing CMM 2012-06) (Attachment F: CMM 2013-09).
WCPFC10,214,"Japan stated that the relevant provisions of UNCLOS, UNFSA and Article 4 of the WCPF Convention make it very clear that the Convention applies only to the high seas and EEZs in the Convention Area but does not apply to territorial seas, archipelagic waters and internal waters, unless otherwise specified such as measures for inspection at port.  Japan stressed that its view on the area of the application on the Convention does not mean that Japan would allow the Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries in its territorial seas and internal waters to be operated without regard to the new Pacific bluefin tuna measure.  Rather, Japan assured WCPFC10 that it would fulfil its responsibility as a major Pacific bluefin tuna fishing nation by conserving and managing this stock in its territorial seas and internal waters in a way that is compatible with the newly adopted CMM."
WCPFC10,215,"The USA noted its request for two revisions to the analyses to be conducted in 2014 in support of the Pacific bluefin rebuilding plan (WCPFC10-2013/DP-31).  It requested that the ISC i) consider two additional management scenarios, and ii) revise the definitions of juvenile and adult fisheries in the analysis to align with those used in previous analyses."
WCPFC10,216,WCPFC10 agreed that the United States’ requests on PBT above be forwarded to ISC for incorporation into the analyses.
WCPFC10,217,WCPFC10 adopted the report of NC9 and asked the SC to evaluate whether North Pacific blue shark would qualify as a northern stock.      33 AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 10.1 Report of the Ninth Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC10,218,"The TCC Chair, Rhea Moss-Christian presented the report of TCC9 (WCPFC10-2013/WP-19).  The following nine recommendations by TCC9 for the consideration of WCPFC10 were highlighted:    i. Extend the manual reporting requirements under the VMS SSPs for one year (TCC9 Report, para. 136); ii. Exempt vessels in good standing on the FFA Vessel Register from requirements to submit a VTAF (TCC9 Report, para. 137); iii. Agree guidelines for timely submission of ROP data (TCC9 Report, para. 160); iv. Include HSBI elements in the CMR process (TCC9 Report, para. 236); v. Task the Secretariat with preparing a report on transhipment activities (TCC9 Report, para. 267); vi. Task the Scientific Services Provider with providing specific information on South Pacific Swordfish to SC10 (TCC9 Report, para.344);  vii. Agree the definition of a purse seine day in transit (TCC9 Report, para. 387);  viii. Clarify that for CMM 2005-03, the reporting responsibility lies with the flag State (TCC9 Report, para. 116); and ix. Clarify that CCMs identify in their 2014 Annual Report Part 2 which metric they used to calculate the percentage of longline observer coverage for 2013 (TCC9 Report, para. 117)."
WCPFC10,219,One CCM queried and received confirmation of their understanding that the flag State reporting responsibility for CMM 2005-03 (North Pacific albacore) refers to the catch and effort reporting responsibilities in paras. 3 and 4 of that CMM.
WCPFC10,220,WCPFC10 adopted TCC9 recommendations i-vi and viii-ix above.
WCPFC10,221,"One CCM queried why the definition of a purse seine day in transit was limited to the area between 10oN and 10oS (TCC9 report, para. 387 and recommendation vii above)."
WCPFC10,222,SPC explained that since the vast majority of purse seine fishing operations take place between 10oN and 10oS it is appropriate to assume that purse seine vessels outside this area are in transit.
WCPFC10,223,"Some CCMs sought further clarification of the wording of the definition of a purse seine day in transit as recommended by TCC9, and as a result the wording of the definition was amended."
WCPFC10,224,"WCPFC10 adopted revised wording for the definition of purse seine effort to be reported on logbooks and the requirements in the “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission” and are consistent with the PNA VDS System and observer reporting:    “The current definition for a purse seine day in transit (‘a day in transit’) should only cover the following cases:    Transiting from port to the tropical WCPFC area (10°N - 10°S); or   34  Transiting back to port; or  Transiting from one fishing zone to another in the Convention Area. Where vessels are transiting as described above, the conditions of transit are that the gear is stowed, with the boom lowered and tied down, and the net covered.”** Footnote: **Subject to any further clarification.”  10.1.1 Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures –Report on Compliance Monitoring Scheme Provisional CMS and Executive Summary"
WCPFC10,225,"The TCC Chair described how TCC9 prepared the Provisional CMR (WCPFC10-2013/20).  The recommendations of TCC9 concerning the development of the Provisional CMR are contained in the TCC9 Summary Report (paras. 81-89).  WCPFC10 was reminded that two recommendations from TCC9 regarding the clarification of compliance obligations arising from CMMs were agreed after consideration by WCPFC10 of the TCC9 Summary Report (see Agenda Item 10.1, recommendations viii and ix).  Given that any additional information submitted by CCMs since TCC9 had not yet been reviewed, the TCC Chair suggested that any necessary updates to the Provisional CMR be considered by a small working group (SWG-CMS)."
WCPFC10,226,"FFA members stated that information submitted since TCC9 should be taken into account before the 2012 CMR is adopted.  These CCMs considered that the CMS is a work in progress and that while it is evolving in a positive way, further enhancements are required."
WCPFC10,227,Two CCMs requested that information they submitted after TCC9 be considered.
WCPFC10,228,One of these CCMs considered that the CMS should aim for greater transparency and asked that the process be open to observers.
WCPFC10,229,"Reporting back from the SWG-CMS, the TCC Chair noted that 16 CCMs provided information additional to that considered in the development of the Provisional CMR.  This information was considered and text from the Provisional CMR was amended and adapted as necessary for the Final CMR.  Draft text for the Executive Summary of the Final CMR was considered by WCPFC10 and within this text wording regarding CCM obligations to provide operational data was adjusted by consensus.  The SWG-CMS recommended that the table of CCMs by obligation and the compliance matrix from the Provisional CMR be included in the Final CMR, noting that this will mean these tables become public information."
WCPFC10,230,"In response to a CCM’s query, it was confirmed that the two tables have been updated based on the work of the SWG-CMS at WCPFC10."
WCPFC10,231,"The SWG-CMS recommended to WCPFC10 to consider a template developed by the Secretariat proposed for use in preparing the 2014 draft Compliance Monitoring Report (WCPFC10-2013/20, Annex II)."
WCPFC10,232,WCPFC10 adopted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report for 2012 containing the adjusted wording of the Executive Summary and two tables from the Provisional CMR (Attachment G).     35
WCPFC10,233,"WCPFC10 adopted a template for preparation of the 2014 draft Compliance Monitoring Report (Attachment H: WCPFC10-2013/20, Annex II)."
WCPFC10,234,"FFA members articulated their support for the evolving CMS process but requested further delineation between the roles of the Secretariat, the TCC and CCMs.  Specifically, there are some components of the CMS that are factual and can be assessed by the Secretariat.  In contrast, some components of the CMS require value judgements and should be assessed by the TCC.  FFA members asked that the Secretariat and the TCC Chair work intersessionally to refine the process for development of the draft CMRs.  Finally, with regard to WCPFC10-2013/20, FFA members considered it the responsibility of TCC, rather than the Secretariat, to decide which paragraphs of the selected CMMs should be included in the draft CMR."
WCPFC10,235,"FFA members stated that in developing the CMS it is important to maintain a long-term, strategic vision of where the CMS should be in ten years’ time including processes to promote greater independence, verification and external review."
WCPFC10,236,"FFA members considered that in developing responses to non-compliance two principles should be maintained.  First, responses should be graduated so that capacity building rather than penalties can be prioritized as responses for SIDS.  Second, the magnitude, and number or duration, of the non-compliances should be taken into account so that inadvertent occurrences can be separated from intentional ones."
WCPFC10,237,"FFA members recognized non-CCMs’ concerns about the closed nature of the CMS process but noted the need to maintain the security of CMS information given past instances of misuse.  It was suggested that the information should remain as non-public domain data under the Commission data rules, but that arrangements such as confidentiality agreements could be developed to allow observer participation. non-public data rules and confidentiality agreements could be developed to allow observer participation and increase transparency."
WCPFC10,238,Some CCMs supported the FFA members’ call for greater transparency and observer participation in the CMS process.
WCPFC10,239,Some CCMs appreciated and emphasized the importance of the Secretariat’s role in the CMS process.  These CCMs stated that the Secretariat provides an essential filtering function which avoids swamping the TCC with more information than it can effectively process.
WCPFC10,240,"The Executive Director stated that the Secretariat is endeavouring to be flexible and respond to the changing demands of the CMS year by year.  However, he noted that the current situation is characterized by differing expectations of the work required over a very short timeframe and a lack of clear direction from the Commission places strain on the relationship between the Secretariat and the TCC Chair."
WCPFC10,241,The Chair noted that there is a continuing lack of clarity about the appropriate roles for the Secretariat and the TCC with regard to the CMS and encouraged CCMs to discuss these issues in the margins of WCPFC10.      36 10.1.2 Adoption of the IUU List for 2014
WCPFC10,242,"The TCC Chair referred WCPFC10 to a paper which summarizes the situation with regard to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2014 (WCPFC10-2013/21).  TCC9 received no requests for removal of any of the vessels currently on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, nor did it receive any nominations for vessels to be added to the list.  Therefore TCC9 recommended to the Commission that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List remain unchanged."
WCPFC10,243,FFA members requested that TCC consider additional ways of working with flag States to seek resolution with those vessels which have remained on the IUU Vessel List for many years.
WCPFC10,244,"FFA members also noted that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List does not reflect all the incidents of IUU fishing which have occurred in the Convention Area.  These CCMs encouraged other CCMs and the Commission as a whole to take a more rigorous approach to analysing these incidents, and the vessels and persons involved, and to develop profiles of behaviour.  It was noted that FFA has begun such work and will discuss it at TCC10."
WCPFC10,245,"WCPFC10 agreed to maintain the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2013 comprising three vessels, the Neptune, the Fu Lien No. 1 and the Yu Fong 168, as the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2014.  (Attachment I)  10.2 Regional Observer Programme-Technical Advisory Group (ROP-TAG) Report"
WCPFC10,246,"Philip Lens, Chair of the ROP-TAG, presented the ROP-TAG’s report for 2013 (WCPFC10-2013/22).  From a total of 19 recommendations from the ROP-TAG, TCC9 endorsed nine recommendations.  The first of these was that notification requirements for fish carriers should be discussed at TCC10 (TCC9 Report para. 177).  WCPFC10 was invited to consider the remaining eight recommendations:    i. Task the Secretariat with developing guidelines for observer credentials (TCC9 Report para. 182); ii. Task the Secretariat with developing a paper on minimum standards to prevent misconduct of observers (TCC9 Report para. 184); iii. Notification of the Secretariat by national observer programmes of the roster of trained observers as soon as practical (TCC9 Report para. 198);  iv. Notification of the Secretariat by national observer programmes of the active observer list every three months (TCC9 Report para. 199); v. Notification of the Secretariat by national observer programmes of any observers removed from the active observer list due to misconduct (TCC9 Report, para. 200); vi. Request CCMs to provide responses on how best to deal with corruption issues for discussion at TCC10 (TCC9 Report, para. 204); vii. Task the Secretariat with preparing an observer handbook of CMMs (TCC9 Report, para. 206); and viii. Reconstitute the Intersessional Working Group-Regional Observer Programme (IWG-ROP) to address ROP implementation issues (TCC9 Report, para. 207)."
WCPFC10,247,"One CCM noted that misconduct in the ROP can originate either from the observers or from the vessel captains and crew, and both aspects of the problem should be examined.  Penalties should be established which discourage misconduct from either party.     37"
WCPFC10,248,"With regard to the IWG-ROP, FFA members stated their cautious support for its re-establishment.  These CCMs stated that many of the ROP issues appear to have reached a stalemate and the burden of holding additional meetings on these issues should be minimized through opportunities to co-host meetings of the IWG-ROP with other meetings, and by providing funding to support SIDS participation."
WCPFC10,249,"The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that TCC9 had also recommended that if the IWG-ROP is re-constituted, it should consider issues associated with observer coverage targets for longline fleets (TCC9 Report, para. 225)."
WCPFC10,250,"WCPFC10 agreed to reconstitute the IWG-ROP and to task it with considering, inter alia, observer coverage targets for longline fleets.   10.3 Intersessional Working Group-Catch Documentation Scheme Report"
WCPFC10,251,"The Executive Director presented a report on the work of the IWG-CDS on behalf of its Chair Alois Kinol (WCPFC10-2013/23).  The first meeting was held shortly after the close of TCC9.  One of the key outcomes was for CCMs to provide background documents and information on their implementation of current CDS-related initiatives.  Papua New Guinea has provided $30,000 US to support a consultant to prepare a paper on these existing schemes and how they might relate to the Commission’s CDS.  The Secretariat is currently working with the Chair of the IWG-CDS to develop terms of reference for the paper.  This paper will form the basis for the next meeting of the IWG-ROP which is likely to be held immediately prior to TCC10."
WCPFC10,252,"FFA members considered that the deadline of end November 2013 for providing information on current CDS-related initiatives was unrealistic and suggested that the deadline be extended to the end of March 2014.  This will allow FFA members to provide more information on their developing regional standards.  These CCMs supported the proposed paper, thanked Papua New Guinea for funding it, and looked forward to discussing it at the proposed pre-TCC10 meeting."
WCPFC10,253,WCPFC10 noted the progress of the IWG-CDS and endorsed its plan to produce an analysis of existing CDS-related initiatives for discussion prior to TCC10.    10.4 Future Work Plan and Budget for 2014-2016
WCPFC10,254,The TCC Chair presented the TCC Work Plan and Budget for 2014-2016 (WCPFC-TCC9-2013/22).
WCPFC10,255,"Some CCMs requested further clarification of the $10,000 US to be used to support a consultancy study on the improvement of purse seine catch composition data."
WCPFC10,256,"The FAC report (WCPFC10-2013/25, para. 23) later clarified that this amount is to be used to undertake a study to identify compliance issues with vessels reporting purse seine species composition in logbooks."
WCPFC10,257,WCPFC10 adopted the TCC Work Plan and Budget for 2014-2016 as proposed by TCC9.     38  10.5 Legal Framework for CMMs
WCPFC10,258,The Secretariat tabled a paper describing the background to this issue and suggestions for a way forward in WCPFC10-2013/29.
WCPFC10,259,This issue was not discussed at WCPFC10.    10.6 Adoption of the TCC9 Report
WCPFC10,260,WCPFC10 adopted the TCC9 Summary Report.    AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 11.1 Consideration of New CMMs and Other Conservation Requirements 11.1.1 Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC10,261,"The USA presented a draft CMM on extension of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (WCPFC10-2013/DP-06).  Comments on the draft CMM were received from CCMs and incorporated.  Key changes were highlighted in the areas of i) the process for producing the Provisional Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR), ii) the categories of compliance (and acknowledging the reasons why non-compliances may occur), iii) the role of the Secretariat, and iv) the process for evaluating the Provisional CMR and producing a Final CMR.  The USA considered that the three years of CMS trials have resulted in useful experience and it is now time to convert the scheme from a one-year to a permanent basis.  In addition, the draft CMM contains a provision to establish an Intersessional Working Group (IWG-CMS) to begin developing responses to non-compliance."
WCPFC10,262,"Some CCMs supported the proposal in general but wished to suggest minor, technical amendments."
WCPFC10,263,FFA members also expressed interest in discussing the details of the proposal.  These CCMs stated that the CMS should be authorized for one year rather than be made permanent.
WCPFC10,264,The Chair suggested that the USA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,265,"After further consultation the USA tabled WCPFC10-2013/DP-06 (rev 1).  Amendments included expanding the scope of the CMS to encompass reporting for seabird and other non-target species, authorizations to fish and the RFV.  The new draft proposal removed the provision allowing CCMs to submit additional information against the Provisional CMR up to 30 days prior to the Commission meeting.  In accordance with input from CCMs, the measure was proposed to run for one year only.  An additional compliance   39 status of “priority non-compliant” was added which would trigger additional compliance review actions."
WCPFC10,266,One CCM requested that language be added to para. 13 to make explicit that the CMR should take into account the confidentiality of the information.
WCPFC10,267,Two CCMs requested that the paragraph allowing CCMs to submit additional information against the Provisional CMR (i.e. after TCC) be retained (para. 18).
WCPFC10,268,The USA noted that allowing CCMs to submit additional information after TCC requires that a SWG be convened at the Commission meeting to review the information and if necessary revise the Provisional CMR.
WCPFC10,269,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (WCPFC-2013/DP-06 (rev ); Attachment J: CMM 2013-02).
WCPFC10,270,"WCPFC10 established in Intersessional Working Group (IWG), chaired by the USA and meeting electronically or in the margins of other meetings, to develop responses to non-compliance.    11.1.2 RFV SSPs Proposal"
WCPFC10,271,"The USA presented a draft CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-07) on Standards, Specifications and Procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV).  The aim of the measure is to improve the reliability and cost effectiveness of the RFV.  TCC9 discussed the draft measure and agreed amendments regarding data submission procedures and standardization of fields.  Although the current draft specifies that vessel photos to be submitted for the RFV must be no older than five years, consensus could not be reached at TCC9 regarding this issue."
WCPFC10,272,FFA members noted that their comments on the draft CMM had been taken into account and that they support the proposal.
WCPFC10,273,The Chair suggested that the USA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,274,"The USA tabled a revised draft (WCPFC-2013/DP-07(rev1)) noting that only one comment was received.  One CCM wished to insert language stating “periodically recommend improvements to these SSPs, including, where appropriate, standards and codes that are consistent with those used in other international fora, such as the FAO and UN/CEFACT” as an additional responsibility of the WCPFC Secretariat (as para. 15 of the RFV SSPs)."
WCPFC10,275,"WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM concerning Standards, Specifications and Procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (Attachment K: CMM 2013-03).      40 11.1.3 Unique Vessel Identifiers"
WCPFC10,276,"The USA introduced a draft CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-08) on implementing a unique vessel identifier (UVI).  The draft proposal, which was discussed at TCC9, would require all vessels >100 GT to obtain a UVI, require flag States to submit these UVIs for inclusion in the WCPFC RFV, and task the Commission with continuing to explore ways of assigning UVIs to all vessels on the RFV.  Based on discussions at TCC9 the exemption for non-steel hulled vessels was removed.  Other suggestions to narrow the scope of the measure to apply to vessels that fish only on the high seas were not incorporated because this would limit the application to only a subset of vessels on the RFV and undermine the value of the UVI scheme."
WCPFC10,277,Some CCMs supported the draft measure as a useful means of tracking fishing vessels that might move between tuna RFMOs.
WCPFC10,278,"Some CCMs, including FFA members, stated they are not comfortable with applying the scheme to vessels which fish solely within the waters of their own flag State.  For this reason, these CCMs wished to engage in further discussion of the draft proposal."
WCPFC10,279,Some CCMs asked that the proposal incorporate a grace period to allow time for flag States to secure UVIs for their fishing vessels.
WCPFC10,280,The Chair suggested that the USA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,281,"After further consultation the USA tabled a revised proposal for discussion (WCPFC10-2013/DP-08 (rev1)).  The USA explained that in response to CCM comments the implementation date for the UVI requirements was postponed from 1 January 2015 to 1 January 2016, which is consistent with the recently adopted ICCAT measure.  In addition, the proposal contains a revised definition of the scope of the requirement which states that it applies to fishing vessels that are “authorized to be used for fishing in the Convention Area beyond the flag CCM’s area of national jurisdiction”.  The four decision points in the proposal include instructions for revising CMM 2009-01 on the WCPFC’s RFV and Authorization to Fish. CMM 2009/01 as it would be revised under the proposal is also available (WCPFC10-2013-DP08 rev1 Part2)"
WCPFC10,282,WCPFC10 adopted new requirements for a unique vessel identifier for inclusion in the CMM for the Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorisation to Fish (Attachment L:  CMM 2013-04)  11.1.4 Catch Reporting
WCPFC10,283,"FFA members introduced a draft CMM requiring vessel operators to maintain daily catch records (WCPFC10-2013/DP-09).  Daily catch logs are required in FFA members’ EEZs but this proposal aims to create an explicit requirement for such records to be kept for high seas fishing activities as well.  This is expected to improve the quality of data available for stock assessments.  Under the proposal the use of regional logsheets for recordkeeping is encouraged but not compulsory.  This proposal was assessed against the criteria for evaluating the potential impacts on SIDS (WCPFC10-2013/DP-02) but it was found that   41 since a daily catch reporting requirement is already in place in EEZs, this measure would not introduce any additional burden to SIDS."
WCPFC10,284,Some CCMs suggested that further discussion of the proposed measure was required.
WCPFC10,285,Some CCMs stressed the urgent need to put catch reporting requirements in place to help fill gaps in knowledge that lead to uncertainties in stock assessments and hinder precautionary management.
WCPFC10,286,The Chair suggested that FFA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,287,FFA members reported that the proposal had been revised several times in response to CCMs’ comments and tabled it for adoption (WCPFC-2013/DP-09 (rev 4)).
WCPFC10,288,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM on daily catch and effort reporting (Attachment M: CMM 2013-05).    11.1.5 Eastern High Seas Pocket (EHSP)
WCPFC10,289,"The Cook Islands introduced a proposal to replace CMM 2010-02 which designates as a special management area the EHSP formed by the EEZs of the Cook Islands, Kiribati and French Polynesia (WCPFC10-2013/DP-10).  The proposal would close the ESHP to fishing, ban transhipment, implement six-hour VMS entry and exit procedures, and mandate special monitoring procedures for the Secretariat.  The draft CMM is considered necessary based on recent experience with misreporting of catches and transhipment infringements in the area, and is supported by the Forum Fisheries Committee Ministerial Meeting."
WCPFC10,290,Some CCMs did not support the proposal on the basis that there may be other potential solutions to the problems encountered in the EHSP.
WCPFC10,291,Some CCMs expressed concern about jurisdictional issues posed by closing areas of the high seas.
WCPFC10,292,One CCM supported the proposal in general and welcomed its ban on high seas transhipment.
WCPFC10,293,"FFA members considered that other solutions short of a full closure of the pocket have been trialed in the past and proved to be unsuccessful.  Therefore, a simpler and more effective solution such as closing the pocket is needed."
WCPFC10,294,"One CCM suggested that since all pockets adjacent to EEZs could be havens for IUU fishing, it could agree to closing the EHSP if all such pockets were closed to fishing."
WCPFC10,295,The Chair suggested that the Cook Islands continue discussions of this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,296,The Cook Islands subsequently offered to replace the originally intended ban on fishing in the EHSP with a ban on transhipment in the EHSP.     42
WCPFC10,297,Some CCMs welcomed and supported the transhipment ban.
WCPFC10,298,"Some CCMs considered that more information on what activities take place in the EHSP should be compiled.  Acknowledging the burden created on CCMs located in close proximity to the EHSP, some of these CCMs suggested that additional measures such as controls on transshipment and enhanced monitoring (e.g. VMS verification as a condition of EHSP entry) could be discussed."
WCPFC10,299,French Polynesia noted that although one-third of the French Navy’s efforts are devoted to MCS activities in the French Polynesia EEZ this level of effort is still insufficient to alleviate concerns about the EHSP.  French Polynesia considered that WCPFC action is needed to improve the situation.
WCPFC10,300,"FFA members expressed several concerns about the EHSP including i) lack of compliance with CMMs regarding VMS, sharks and EHSP reporting requirements; ii) detrimental effects on SIDS from the lack of transhipment in port; and iii) uncontrolled fishing for South Pacific albacore.  These CCMs noted that having to deal with the MCS problems created by the EHSP represents a burden on SIDS, and considered that the best solution would be to close the EHSP."
WCPFC10,301,"Greenpeace, WWF and the Pew Charitable Trusts stressed the serious nature of the situation in the EHSP and urged WCPFC10 to close the EHSP to both fishing and transhipment."
WCPFC10,302,"Based on further consultation the Cook Islands revised the proposal for WCPFC10’s consideration (WCPFC10-2013/DP-10 (rev 1)).  In recognition of the contentious nature of the transhipment ban, the Cook Islands noted that while this was still the preferred option in the proposal, a one-year phasing out of transhipment or other alternatives could be considered.  A number of other catch and effort reporting, VMS, HSBI, non-compliance responses and Secretariat reporting components were included in this revised proposal."
WCPFC10,303,"The Cook Islands subsequently withdrew the proposal due to a lack of support from some CCMs.  However, it considered there is strong support for the phasing out of EHSP transhipment over time.  The Secretariat was asked to continue diligently monitoring the situation.  Noting the mandate from the Forum Leaders, the Cook Islands stated it will continue to work toward effective controls in the EHSP and invited CCMs to cooperate with it in this endeavor."
WCPFC10,304,France and French Polynesia expressed their gratitude to the Cook Islands for championing the proposal.  These CCMs consider that the WCPFC must strengthen its MCS tools and systems in order to improve control of activities in the EHSP and reduce the burden placed on surrounding EEZs.    11.1.6 Port State Measures
WCPFC10,305,"FFA members introduced a proposal for port State measures (WCPFC10-2013/DP-11).  This proposal is designed to fill a gap in the Commission’s ability to identify and pursue IUU vessels to non-CCM ports or ports outside of the Convention area.  The proposal introduces the concept of “vessels of interest”, promotes greater cooperation amongst   43 CCMs, builds upon subregional MCS arrangements, and would avoid placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS."
WCPFC10,306,The EU noted that it had submitted a similar proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-15) but it was willing to consider the FFA proposal as the basis for the WCPFC port State measure.
WCPFC10,307,The Chair instructed CCMs to discuss the proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,308,FFA members reported that the proposal had gone through three revisions (WCPFC10-2013/DP-11 (rev 3)) but there was still no consensus on its adoption.  These CCMs stated their intention to use the revised proposal as the basis for discussion of a port state measure at TCC10 and WCPFC11.
WCPFC10,309,Some CCMs expressed their disappointment that WCPFC10 could not adopt a port state measure but looked forward to further discussions next year.
WCPFC10,310,"One CCM stated that delicate domestic discussions are underway concerning port state issues and thus while it is not in position to agree port state measures this year, it hopes to participate in a more constructive discussion next year.    11.1.7 Sharks"
WCPFC10,311,"The EU presented its proposal on a no-retention measure for silky sharks (WCPFC10-2013/DP-17).  While the EU stated its support for the FFA proposal for a revised shark CMM, it considered that a specific measure is necessary to conserve and manage silky sharks given the findings of SC9 that the stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring."
WCPFC10,312,One CCM stated it could support the draft CMM if the prohibition on sale of silky sharks was removed.
WCPFC10,313,"FFA members generally supported the proposal but noted that sharks that are dead when brought to the vessel will be discarded and therefore wasted.  Furthermore, the measure does not assist in reducing the number of silky sharks brought to the vessel in the first place and therefore other mitigation measures are required."
WCPFC10,314,The Chair requested that the EU continue discussions on the silky shark CMM in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,315,The EU subsequently tabled a revised proposal with the prohibition on sale of silky sharks removed (WCPFC10-2013/DP-17 (rev 1)).
WCPFC10,316,"Some CCMs stated that they reluctantly supported the proposed measure because they considered the scientific support for such a measure to be not absolutely clear. These CCMs requested that the text be re-worded to apply only to silky sharks caught in the WCPF Convention Area because the species is allowed to be taken in the IATTC Convention Area.  Furthermore, these CCMs requested text be added to the effect that the measure would be amended on the basis of the most recent stock assessment advice."
WCPFC10,317,"Some CCMs, while supporting the proposal, considered that a delayed implementation date of 1 July 2014 would be preferred.     44"
WCPFC10,318,One CCM asked whether there would be any provision in the measure to provide implementation assistance to national observer programmes.
WCPFC10,319,"WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM on no-retention of silky sharks which included amendments to i) restrict the scope to silky sharks caught in the WCPF Convention Area, ii) amend the measure based on the latest stock assessment results, and iii) delay implementation of the proposal until 1 July 2014 (Attachment N: CMM 2013-08)."
WCPFC10,320,The EU presented its proposal to require that all sharks be landed with their fins naturally attached (WCPFC10-2013/DP-16).  The EU noted that this proposal is consistent with its domestic policy but may need to be modified to read “fins naturally attached to the whole carcass” in order to prevent the skinning of sharks onboard.  The EU expressed a willingness to find common ground between this proposal and the FFA’s proposal for shark fins to be naturally attached.
WCPFC10,321,One CCM supported the EU’s proposal on the basis that it has both scientific and conservation benefits.
WCPFC10,322,The EU subsequently stated that it had tabled a revision to its proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-16 (rev 1)) but considered that support for the proposal was lacking given discussions underway concerning the requirement to land sharks with their fins attached under the FFA shark proposal.  The EU reaffirmed its commitment to seeing a fins-attached requirement established in all tuna RFMOs.
WCPFC10,323,"FFA members presented a proposal for a revised shark CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-12).  The objective of the proposal was to strengthen shark conservation and incorporate information presented at SC9 by requiring catch and discard reporting by species, requiring that fins remain naturally attached until landing, banning wire leaders and shark lines, and requiring management plans and limits on shark catches in shark-targeted fisheries."
WCPFC10,324,Some CCMs expressed qualified support for the proposal but wished to engage in further discussion of details.
WCPFC10,325,One CCM opposed the proposal on the basis that it would have adverse impacts on crew safety.
WCPFC10,326,The Chair asked that interested CCMs discuss the draft CMM in a small working group which Palau offered to lead.
WCPFC10,327,"Palau subsequently tabled a revised draft measure (WCPFC10-2013/DP-12 (rev 9)) but stated that consensus on a comprehensive measure could not be reached.  The revised text removed the provisions for which there was no consensus and called for i) an integrated and comprehensive shark CMM to be developed in 2014, and ii) for fisheries that target sharks to develop management plans."
WCPFC10,328,"One CCM raised a number of issues with the proposed text including questions about the preambular wording, the definition of ‘viscera’, the ability to develop appropriate mitigation measures in the specified timeframe without any specific proposals, and the requirement to apply a purse seine shark handling handbook which are not developed.    45 Given the number of outstanding concerns, this CCM stated that it could not support the current draft proposal."
WCPFC10,329,Some CCM’s pointed out that it was not clear how the revised proposal tracked the existing shark CMM (CMM 2010-07).
WCPFC10,330,Palau withdrew the proposal pending further consideration next year.  It suggested that the SC investigate shark bycatch mitigation methods in 2014 and that WCPFC11 develop an integrated and comprehensive shark CMM.  Palau invited the Commission to adopt this as a recommendation by consensus.
WCPFC10,331,"While many CCM’s supported Palau’s proposal, there was not consensus to adopt it as a Commission recommendation.    11.1.8 Proposal on Fisheries Access Agreements"
WCPFC10,332,"The EU presented a proposal on fisheries and access agreements information (WCPFC10-2013/DP-14).  Noting that this proposal was also tabled at WCPFC9, the EU considered that making fishing agreements public is extremely important for transparency in the region."
WCPFC10,333,One CCM supported the proposal on the grounds that it would increase transparency.
WCPFC10,334,One CCM expressed concerns about how the required information could be submitted to the Secretariat in cases of short-term or spur of the moment fishing agreements.
WCPFC10,335,FFA members stated that they do not support the proposal because some of the information is commercially sensitive and cannot be released.
WCPFC10,336,There was no further discussion of this proposal at WCPFC10.    11.1.9 Pacific Bluefin Tuna (PBF)
WCPFC10,337,A draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (WCPFC10-2013/27) was discussed under Agenda Item 9 (Northern Committee).    11.1.10 South Pacific Albacore
WCPFC10,338,"New Zealand, on behalf of some FFA members, presented a draft of a revised CMM for South Pacific albacore (WCPFC10-2013/DP-34).  Management of this fishery is considered critical to SIDS’ domestic longline industries and it was noted with concern that catches have doubled in the last decade despite the adoption of CMMs in 2005 and 2010 designed to limit entry.  The proposed CMM includes provisions to deter the continuing influx of vessels to albacore fishing grounds south of the equator, limits on catches in the high seas and overlap areas to 2006-2010 levels, and zone-based catch limits for CCMs which prevent growth in some fisheries but allow for it in others.      46"
WCPFC10,339,Some CCMs expressed concerns about the limits on the number of fishing vessels being defined relative to the equator rather than 20oS as in the previous measures.  One CCM also questioned the basis for limiting catches to 2006-2010 levels and suggested that catch limits should be based on a new stock assessment.
WCPFC10,340,"Several CCMs including FFA members and Participating Territories, some of whom are economically dependent on South Pacific albacore, supported the proposal."
WCPFC10,341,FFA members called for the information paper on South Pacific albacore (WCPCFC10-2013/IP-02) to be updated each year.
WCPFC10,342,Some CCMs considered that the northern boundary for the CMM should be 10oS rather than the equator.
WCPFC10,343,Some CCMs suggested that in order to avoid restricting troll fisheries the CMM should explicitly define to which gear types and fleets any high seas vessel and catch limits would apply.
WCPFC10,344,"Based on consultations held during WCPFC10, New Zealand tabled a revised proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-34 (rev 3))."
WCPFC10,345,"China stated that although it could not support the revised draft CMM for South Pacific albacore, as of September 2013 the Fisheries Administration of China has implemented a cap of 400 China-flagged vessels authorized to target South Pacific albacore.  China expressed a willingness to work toward a revised CMM for South Pacific albacore at WCPFC11 and will continue to work with SIDS to assist in developing their domestic longline fisheries.  China requested that a new stock assessment for South Pacific albacore be conducted as soon as possible."
WCPFC10,346,"New Zealand expressed its disappointment that WCPFC10 could not adopt a new CMM for South Pacific albacore, particularly as some SIDS have already taken actions such as lowering their catch levels to ensure the viability of the stock.  While China’s cap on the number of vessels was welcomed, New Zealand noted that this would not remedy existing over-capacity in the fishery."
WCPFC10,347,"FFA members stated that South Pacific albacore is a mainstay for many of their domestic longline fisheries but it does not receive the attention it deserves within the WCPFC.  In discussions at WCPFC10 good progress was made toward reducing the increasing trends in catch and effort, but this progress was halted when high seas and overlap area catch limits were not supported.  China’s transparency regarding its cap of 400 vessels is appreciated, and China’s need to develop its own shipbuilding and fishing industries, and provide food security for its own people, is recognized.  Nevertheless, SIDS cannot compete with heavily subsidized fleets from China and if the current situation continues catch rates will decline below the point of economic viability for SIDS’s fleets.  FFA members consider that the Commission’s inaction with regard to South Pacific albacore represents a significant disproportionate burden on SIDS and is in direct conflict with Article 30 of the Convention.  These CCMs look forward to cooperating with China on South Pacific albacore issues in 2014 and to support for a new South Pacific albacore CMM at WCPFC11.      47"
WCPFC10,348,One CCM acknowledged the initial step taken by China to control capacity but expressed disappointment that no new or interim CMM could be agreed by WCPFC10.  This CCM considered that there is an urgent need to strengthen the management of the South Pacific albacore fishery and expressed its commitment to develop a new CMM for WCPFC11.
WCPFC10,349,The Cook Islands echoed the position of FFA members and noted the importance of controlling South Pacific albacore catch and effort on the high seas in order to reduce the potential for encroachment into the Cook Islands EEZ.    11.1.11 FFA Draft CMM on Criteria for Consideration of CMM Proposals
WCPFC10,350,The Chair noted that FFA members tabled a proposed CMM requiring that the impact of conservation and management proposals on SIDS be assessed and the results be attached in the form of explanatory note to the draft proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35) (also see Agenda Item 3.3).
WCPFC10,351,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, led consultations with CCMs on this proposal at WCPFC10 and tabled a revised draft for discussion (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35 (rev 3)).  RMI explained that the draft CMM was designed to incorporate Article 30 of the Convention into the decision-making process of the Commission."
WCPFC10,352,Japan referred to its presentation on its small fishing communities and stated its desire to reflect those issues in the CMM.  It proposed to replace references to “SIDS” with references to “CCMs” or to add references to “small fishing communities of non-SIDS”.
WCPFC10,353,FFA members responded that to do so would be inconsistent with Article 30 of the Convention as it specifically refers to SIDS.
WCPFC10,354,One CCM questioned how the assessment of the impact of conservation and management proposals on SIDS should be carried out.
WCPFC10,355,"One CCM considered that it, like many other CCMs, take on burdens as a result of cooperating with the Commission in responsible fisheries management.  Therefore, the question is not whether burdens are being incurred but rather whether they are appropriately apportioned among CCMs.  This CCM shared FFA’s concern for robust and profitable fishing industries in Pacific island countries and asked that the draft CMM use terminology inclusive of Participating Territories as they share many of the same characteristics as SIDS."
WCPFC10,356,One CCM noted that the first option should be to seek to avoid placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS.
WCPFC10,357,FFA members stated their view that the references in the WCPF Convention to SIDS include Participating Territories.  They also reminded CCMs that the requirements contained in the draft CMM already exist in the Convention and are simply being formulated as a checklist to be used in an assessment of impacts and mitigation options.
WCPFC10,358,"After further discussions in the margins of WCPFC10, FFA members tabled a revised draft CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35 (rev 4)).  This draft contained wording which would   48 require new proposals to consider which CCMs the proposal would impact and in which ways."
WCPFC10,359,Japan stated that it could accept the revised draft if the Commission in parallel adopted a statement that similar consideration would be given to small fishing communities in non-SIDS.
WCPFC10,360,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM on criteria for consideration of the impact of conservation and management proposals on SIDS and Participating Territories (Attachment O:  CMM 2013-06).
WCPFC10,361,WCPFC10 agreed that similar consideration shall be given to small fishing communities of non-SIDS CCMs.    11.1.12 FFA Draft CMM on Special Requirements of SIDS and Territories
WCPFC10,362,The Chair noted that FFA members tabled a proposed CMM requiring the Commission to give full consideration to the special requirements of SIDS (WCPFC10-2013/DP-36) (also see Agenda Item 3.3).
WCPFC10,363,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, led consultations with CCMs on this proposal at WCPFC10 and tabled a revised draft (WCPFC10-2013/DP-36 (rev 3)).  The aim of the proposal is to operationalize Article 30 of the WCPF Convention by turning principles into actions.  It was noted that the revised proposal had removed contentious text and represented a significant compromise."
WCPFC10,364,"FFA members urged WCPFC10 to endorse the proposal as an international benchmark in recognizing the aspirations of SIDS.  In addition to operationalizing the requirements of Article 30 of the WCPF Convention, these CCMs considered that the proposed measure also reflects the intent of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the Barbados Programme of Action, and would support the goals of genuine and enduring partnerships under the upcoming UN Conference on SIDS in Samoa.  FFA members stated that the measure was necessary to give greater attention to supporting local and small-scale fleets by striking a balance in the benefits of the fishery to developed and developing States."
WCPFC10,365,"Some CCMs expressed support for the draft CMM stating that it is useful in identifying priorities for cooperation and assistance in capacity building, technology transfer, fisheries management, MCS and domestic industry development.  Some of these CCMs noted that they already provide significant support to SIDS in these areas."
WCPFC10,366,"Some CCMs, while supporting the general concept, expressed concerns about the extent to which the measure created obligations for assistance.  These CCMs considered that such obligations could lead to non-compliances if, for example, economic conditions lead to changing budgets or national initiatives do not align with the priorities in the measure."
WCPFC10,367,"The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), on behalf of Guam and American Samoa, articulated its support for the draft measure and noted that as Participating Territories they also have aspirations for development.      49"
WCPFC10,368,RMI agreed to conduct further consultations and returned with a revised draft CMM (WCPFC-2013/DP-36 (rev 4)).  The concerns of some CCMs about the creation of obligations were addressed by including language stating that developed CCMs will endeavour to cooperate.  Other concerns about trade issues were addressed by specifying that trade barriers that are not consistent with international laws and regulations should be eliminated.
WCPFC10,369,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM operationalizing the special requirements of SIDS and territories (Attachment P:  CMM 2013-07).    11.2 Report by PNA Members on the Vessel Day Scheme
WCPFC10,370,The Chair recalled that PNA members informed WCPFC8 that they would no longer be presenting reports on the Vessel Day Scheme to the Commission.  Future Commission meeting agendas will take note of this.    AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  AD HOC TASK GROUP-DATA (AHTG-Data) 12.1 New Chairperson
WCPFC10,371,The Chair called for nominations for a Chair of the AHTG-Data but none were forthcoming.    12.2 Work Plan for 2014 and 2015
WCPFC10,372,The Chair noted that the work of this subsidiary body would not progress without a chair to lead it.    AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE (FAC) 13.1 Budget Approval for 2014 and Indicative Budgets for 2015 and 2016
WCPFC10,373,"The report of the seventh meeting of the FAC, including a proposed Commission budget for 2014 in the amount of $7,320,178 US, was tabled for WCPFC10’s approval (WCPFC10-2013/25)."
WCPFC10,374,"One CCM noted, and the Secretariat confirmed, that the second line in Note 6 should be deleted (i.e. “inclusion for 2014/15 subject to WCPFC10 decision”)."
WCPFC10,375,WCPFC10 adopted the summary report and recommendations of FAC7 (WCPFC10-2013/25).  (Attachment Q)    50 AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 14.1 Future Structure of the Commission’s Meeting
WCPFC10,376,The Chair invited WCPFC10 to consider the Secretariat’s previous paper on Commission meeting arrangements (WCPFC9-2012/21).
WCPFC10,377,This item was not discussed at WCPFC10.   14.2 Strategic Plan
WCPFC10,378,The Executive Director introduced an updated version of the Commission’s Strategic Plan (WCPFC10-2013/24).  This document was first tabled for the Commission’s consideration at WCPFC6 as part of the report of the FAC.  At WCPFC9 it was recommended to move this item from the FAC to the Commission’s agenda.  The Secretariat has updated the document to reflect the work plans developed at SC9 and TCC9.
WCPFC10,379,FFA members considered that the plan functions as more of a short-term business plan than as a forward-looking vision of the Commission’s aspirations on stock status and the flows of benefits from the fisheries.  These CCMs acknowledged that strategic goals will take time to develop but stated that the strategic plan can be a focal point for this type of constructive debate.
WCPFC10,380,The Executive Director remarked that a strategic plan as called for by FFA members involves policy development and should be led by CCMs rather than by the Secretariat.
WCPFC10,381,FFA members requested that the Secretariat consider this matter intersessionally and report back to WCPFC11.    14.3 Election of Officers
WCPFC10,382,The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that TCC9 recommended Rhea Moss-Christian (FSM) to continue as Chair of the TCC.
WCPFC10,383,Several CCMs spoke in appreciation of the excellent work of Ms Moss-Christian as TCC Chair.
WCPFC10,384,WCPFC10 accepted the nomination of TCC9 and confirmed Rhea Moss-Christian as Chair of the TCC.
WCPFC10,385,Philip Lens (PNG) was nominated to chair the IWG-ROP.
WCPFC10,386,WCPFC10 confirmed Philip Lens as Chair of the IWG-ROP.
WCPFC10,387,"The Chair noted that the Chair of the FAC, Moses Amos (Vanuatu) is taking up a new position and cannot continue in his role as chair.  Mr Amos was thanked for his efforts on behalf of the FAC."
WCPFC10,388,Dr Paul Callaghan (USA) was nominated to chair the FAC.   51
WCPFC10,389,WCPFC10 confirmed Dr Paul Callaghan as Chair of the FAC.
WCPFC10,390,"The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that the positions of SC Vice-Chair, FAC Vice-Chair and AHTG-Data Chair are vacant and requested that CCMs consider nominations intersessionally.    14.4 Future Meetings"
WCPFC10,391,"The Chair announced that WCPFC11 will be held in Apia, Samoa and WCPFC12 will be held in Bali, Indonesia."
WCPFC10,392,"Samoa expressed its appreciation to Indonesia for allowing Samoa to host WCPFC11.  As Samoa will be the venue for the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States on 1-4 September 2014, hosting WCPFC11 will take advantage of the facilities being constructed for this conference before they are dismantled in December 2014.  Samoa promised a warm welcome to all WCPFC11 participants."
WCPFC10,393,"The Executive Director announced the dates of WCPFC meetings in 2014 as follows:  o SC10 to be held in Majuro, RMI from 6-14 August o TCC10 to be held in Pohnpei, FSM from 25-30 September o WCPFC11 to be held in Apia, Samoa from 1-5 December"
WCPFC10,394,Japan noted that dates for NC10 will be set later but confirmed that the meeting is typically held in the first week of September in Japan.
WCPFC10,395,"Japan asked that the Commission consider a randomized, rather than alphabetical, seating arrangement for future meetings.    AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  OTHER MATTERS  15.1 Issues Raised by Participants"
WCPFC10,396,"The CITES Secretariat noted that five shark species (porbeagle, oceanic whitetip, and scalloped, smooth and great hammerhead sharks), as well as both manta ray species were listed on CITES Appendix II at the last Conference of the Parties to CITES in March 2013.  These listings, which will take effect on 14 September 2014, do not prohibit international trade but require strict regulation and control to avoid utilization incompatible with these species’ survival.  After the listings take effect international trade in these species will require CITES permits and certificates confirming they were harvested legally and sustainably.  Acknowledging that national and regional fishery management agencies and organizations have the main responsibility for managing fishery resources, the CITES Secretariat considered that CITES can complement this by encouraging legal and sustainable fishing practices.  The CITES Secretariat is committed to assisting CITES parties with implementation and has received 1.2 million Euros from the EU to support joint actions with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.  These actions   52 will be targeted toward regional fisheries management organizations and developing countries to strengthen scientific, institutional or enforcement capacities.  The CITES Secretariat offered to collaborate with the WCPFC through a dedicated discussion of issues and species of common interest at a future session of the Commission."
WCPFC10,397,The Chair welcomed the suggestion from the CITES Secretariat and noted that the WCPFC Secretariat would consult with the CITES Secretariat on these issues.
WCPFC10,398,"A representative of the University of the South Pacific announced that under its revised strategic plan the university will offer new undergraduate and postgraduate programmes designed to support the tuna industry.  The programmes will focus on capacity building and research and development, and will work with Council of Regional Organizations of the Pacific (CROP) agencies.    15.2 Contract Term for the Executive Director"
WCPFC10,399,"The Chair noted that a Heads of Delegation meeting was convened in the margins of WCPFC10 to discuss the contract arrangements for the Executive Director.  The incumbent Executive Director’s initial four-year term commenced on 26th September 2010 and will therefore expire on 25 September 2014, which is during the 2014 intersessional period."
WCPFC10,400,"WCPFC10 noted the following outcomes of the Heads of Delegation meeting:    i. The Commission is happy with the Executive Director’s performance and is prepared to reappoint him to a further term of four years; ii. The Chair of the Commission is empowered to inform the Executive Director of this position and request that should he decide not to complete the four year term, that the Executive Director give the Commission adequate notice so as to allow for the necessary arrangements of recruitment and appointment of a replacement Executive Director; iii. The current Commission Rules and Procedures are not adequate regarding procedures for the re-appointment of the Executive Director and related matters.  Work should be undertaken during 2014, with a view to bringing a proposal to WCPFC11 that will include:   a. reviewing existing regulations to see where there might be clarity needed with respect to the relationship between the Executive Director and the Chair; b. developing a process for the performance evaluation of the Executive Director; and  c. outlining a process for the contract negotiation for the Executive Director."
WCPFC10,401,"The Chair informed WCPFC10 that he had conveyed the four-year reappointment offer to the Executive Director, and noted that the Executive Director indicated that he would consider it and inform the Chair of his decision as soon as possible.  The Chair stated that he would inform CCMs of the Executive Director’s decision once it is received.      53 AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  SUMMARY REPORT"
WCPFC10,402,"A summary report was prepared by the rapporteur and the Secretariat, and circulated to CCMs for comment.  AGENDA  ITEM  17  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC10,403,"The Chair expressed the Commission’s sincere appreciation to Dr Martin Tsamenyi who will step down as WCPFC Legal Advisor after WCPFC10.  As a symbol of their heartfelt thanks, the Chair and the Secretariat presented Dr Tsamenyi with an Akubra hat."
WCPFC10,404,"Fiji recognized Dr Tsamenyi’s unparalleled contributions to capacity building in the region, as demonstrated by his long history of participation in the formation and operation of the WCPFC, his services to regional universities, and his authorship of key national fisheries legislation, most recently in Fiji."
WCPFC10,405,The Cook Islands called for a moment of silence in remembrance of Navy Epati and Colin Brown who passed away in 2013.  Both men will be sorely missed not only for their significant contributions to the work of the Commission but also for their unique and likeable characters.
WCPFC10,406,Indonesia stated that it intended to prioritize the protection of fish workers and their rights and to improve working conditions on WCPFC authorized vessels by developing a CMM for discussion at WCPFC11.
WCPFC10,407,"FFA members expressed their satisfaction with the two new CMMs regarding the rights of SIDS and thanked the Chair for his leadership.  FFA members wished to clarify that they consider the use of the term SIDS to include WCPFC Participating Territories.  However, FFA members stated their grave concern regarding a growing trend, evidenced by the agreement language proposed by Japan in relation to its coastal communities and the insertion of Indonesia in the SIDS exemptions from the capacity measure, to equating these countries’ social and economic challenges to those of SIDS.  The special legal status of SIDS under the WCPF Convention and many other international legal instruments must be respected, and not undermined by placing other groups at the same level."
WCPFC10,408,"The Chair thanked the Secretariat for their excellent support of the meeting and closed WCPFC10 at 18:20 on Friday, 6 December 2013."
